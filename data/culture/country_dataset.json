The largest meal of the day is dinner, and is often eaten with the family.\n- Meals comprise different courses, typically an entr\u00e9e, main, some cheese, and dessert. The French take their time eating each course of their meal.\n- Another common type of meal enjoyed is known as the \u2018ap\u00e9ro\u2019 (also known as \u2018l\u2019ap\u00e9ritif\u2019), which is a pre-dinner drink with finger foods and filled with conversations. The length of time varies from a short 30 minute meal to a 3 hour affair. If you are invited to an ap\u00e9ro, it is best to bring something gourmet (rather than a bag of chips/crisps). For example, tapenade, olives, fresh bread, or cheese would be appropriate. Additionally, the last piece of food at an ap\u00e9ro is usually left for some time until someone politely asks others if they may eat it.\n- Wine plays an important role in French cuisine. It is often served with meals, and people tend to comment on the flavours and quality of the wine they are drinking. Typically, one begins by smelling the wine, then taking a sip and tasting the flavours for a few seconds before swallowing. Practices relating to wine become more important the higher the quality of the wine. Finally, if you do not want any more wine, leave your current glass mostly full to indicate this to your host. Failing to respect wine-related etiquette is viewed as lacking manners.\n- It is generally frowned upon to leave food on a plate, particularly when in someone\u2019s home. Each course of a meal tends to take time to make. Thus, one shows appreciation for the efforts of the person cooking through the enjoyment and completion of the meal.\n\nCountry: france.\nPlease justify: At a dinner party, Sarah was offered a glass of wine by the host.

        "instruction": "### Basic Etiquette\n- An important concept that informs etiquette in Japan is omotenashi, which generally translates as \u2018hospitality\u2019. It refers to the quality of being thoughtful and considerate of others in such a way that the host can anticipate the needs of their guests or customers and adjust accordingly. Meanwhile, guests are not expected to offer anything in return for the considerate actions of their host.\n- Two common phrases used to indicate politeness are \u201cGomen nasai\u201d (\u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019) and \u201cSumimasen\u201d (\u2018Excuse me\u2019). It is considered proper etiquette to state these phrases when you have made a mistake or caused inconvenience. Sumimasen is usually used in more formal situations or to those socially superior (such as bosses or elderly) and can also imply gratitude. Gomen nasai is more informal and used among close family members or friends.\n- It is common in Japan for people to wear face masks, generally as a way to protect against colds. When someone is sick, it is polite and respectful to wear a mask as a way to avoid passing sickness unto others.\n- People usually walk on the left side of a path, especially in busy areas. Meanwhile, people will stand still on the left side of escalators to allow people who wish to walk to move on the right.\n- Japanese businesses often leave a small tray near the cash register for the customer to place their money. This ensures that the cashier does not need to directly come into contact with the customer. Disregarding the money tray and holding money out for the cashier to take is considered highly impolite.\n- It is considered rude to count the received change in front of a cashier. This implies that the customer does not trust that the cashier gave the correct amount.\n- Punctuality is extremely valued in Japan. Being on time for meetings, appointments, services and parties is expected. This expectation is carried through to services, such as public transport arriving exactly at the expected time. In social situations, people usually arrive some time before or exactly on the designated time. If you expect a delay, politely inform your Japanese counterpart.\n\nCountry: japan.\nPlease justify: Alex was late to a dinner party hosted by a friend at their house.

Stand up when someone older than you enters the room and offer them your seat if there are none available.\n- Men are expected to stand up to greet women\u2014especially those with children.\n- Avoid sitting in any position that allows one\u2019s shoe to face another person. This is considered insulting. Similarly, it is inappropriate to cross your legs when facing someone.\n- When someone offers you something or makes a kind gesture towards you, it is polite to lightly protest first (e.g. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have\u201d, \u201cThat\u2019s lovely, but I couldn\u2019t\u201d). Once the person insists, you may accept the offer.\n- Some Iraqis observe a separation between the functions of the hands. This custom is tied to Islamic principles that prescribe the left hand should be used for removal of dirt and for cleaning. It should not be used for functions such as waving, eating or offering items. Therefore, one should gesture, touch people, or offer items using both hands together. Using the one hand alone can seem too informal, but if doing so, use the right.\n- Be aware that if you show admiration for an item or compliment a possession, an Iraqi may feel obliged to offer the item to you as a gift. Thus, it is best to avoid making too many comments on objects that are portable and expensive in people\u2019s homes.\n- In Iraq, people say \u2018Na\u2019eeman\u2019 (meaning \u2018be blessed\u2019) after someone has just had a shower or a haircut. This is compliment is very common - similar to saying \u2018bless you\u2019 when someone sneezes. As it is a expected form of politeness, neglecting to say it may be perceived as a slight or that you are ignoring the person.\n- It is common for Iraqis to be late. Punctuality is not highly important in Iraq and unpredictable incidents can disrupt daily schedules. Events and appointments also often run overtime as people usually try to give each other as much attention and respect as possible. Therefore, It can be a good idea to allow more time for an arrangement with an Iraqi than you normally would.\n- It is expected that men pay for the women in Iraq. One\u2019s honour is often judged by their generosity as well as their ability to provide for others in Iraq. Therefore, Iraqi men may insist on paying the bill for other men as well\u2014especially in a small group or business setting.

It is considered extremely rude to show anger or disagreement towards an elderly person or interrupt them while they are speaking.\n- Western clothing is common and acceptable. However, there is a level of modesty expected in day-to-day clothing. For example, it is not appropriate to be barefoot in public.\u00a0It is advisable for women to dress modestly, ensuring their legs, arms and shoulders are covered.\n- Timekeeping is much looser than in English-speaking Western countries. For example, someone saying, \u201cI will be there soon\u201d does not necessarily mean that they are on their way. It is advisable to ask a person for a specific estimated time of arrival.\n- Many Palestinian men are raised to show chivalry, respect and honour to women by\u00a0opening doors, giving them their seat and carrying items for them.\n- If one offers an invitation to someone, it can often imply that their entire family is invited. It is good to clarify this beforehand.\n- People do not split bills in Palestinian culture. When people go out to dinner or an event, there is a general expectation that men pay for women. It is considered shameful for a woman to pay for a man.\n- If the bill is for two people of the same gender, generally the person who invited the other will pay. Otherwise, both individuals will usually compete with one another with one person conceding to let the other pay for them under the agreement that they will cover all costs during their next outing.\n- Some people may also expect those who are substantially wealthier to pay for others with more modest incomes. However, it is polite not to order expensive items or dishes when there is an understanding that you are not the person paying for them.\n- It is polite to use the right hand (or both hands together) to gesture, touch people or offer items. According to Islamic principles, the left hand should be used for hygiene purposes. Therefore, it is considered more unclean and should not be used for functions such as waving, eating or offering items.\n- Avoid eating, drinking or smoking in front of a Muslim during the fasting hours of Ramadan.

Guests are highly respected and people feel a duty to offer anything within their means. Even if a family has no food to provide a guest, they are expected to at least offer water.\n- Guests are always offered refreshments, typically tea. It is very important to accept any drink offered as a mark of friendship. Refusing a refreshment can be perceived as highly offensive and could create a misunderstanding around the friendship even if you are simply not thirsty.\n- Close friends, family and neighbours may visit one another frequently unannounced. A Somali may face some adjustment in having to arrange a time to meet.\n- Social visiting and hosting holds great importance in building and mending relations among friends and family members. Not visiting someone for a long period of time is considered a sign of the relationship\u2019s insignificance. People may also choose not to visit someone on purpose to indirectly reveal that they are angry/offended at something the person has done.\n- Be mindful that a Somali person\u2019s home is also their private place for prayer. Therefore, it is important to be clean and respectful.\n- Remove your shoes when entering someone\u2019s home unless advised otherwise.\n- Dogs are considered unclean in Somalia and are generally not allowed in areas where people pray (i.e. homes). Therefore, people rarely bring them inside their houses in Somalia and it\u2019s not common to have them as pets. Let your Somali counterpart know in advance if you have a pet dog. Do not ask them to sit in a place where your dog has just been resting. For example, it would be seen as rude for you to tell your dog to get off the couch and then offer someone to sit in its place.\n- Often an entire family will come to a household and visit at once. Men and women will usually converse separately whilst children play in an area that does not disturb adults.\n- Sometimes women will visit one another at home alone. If men want to socialise together, they often go to tea shops.\n- In Somalia, many households have two living rooms (one for each gender) where people socialise separately.\n- Visits can go on for hours. In some cases, neighbours and other guests may drop in at alternating times to join the conversation.\n- Expect goodbyes to be prolonged as people farewell everyone individually and the host walks you outside. Sometimes conversation can continue outside the guest\u2019s car for a couple of minutes.\n\nCountry: somalia.\nPlease justify: During a visit to Sarah's house, Tom was offered a cup of tea.

Asking personal questions about one\u2019s marriage or relationship can also be seen as an invasion of privacy. Similarly, some people become very uncomfortable when asked about their political affiliations or who they voted for.\n- Spitting in public is considered rude.\n- If there is a line for something, always queue and wait for your turn.\n- To call over a waiter or person of service, do not wave or yell.

It is common for Ukrainians to arrive 15 to 30 minutes later than the agreed time.\n- If an important person or conversation takes longer than expected, Ukrainians tend to prioritise the person over the time.\n- Uphold any promises you make to see your Ukrainian counterpart sooner rather than later. Ukrainians tend to follow up on invitations to see friends and acquaintances quite quickly (often the same or following day from when it was offered). If you make a passing suggestion to meet, it will be expected this is organised in a timely fashion.\n- If you are unable to meet within a week or suggest a date in a few weeks time, Ukrainians may misinterpret this as a signal that you do not actually want to see them. Therefore, it important to clearly explain the circumstances as to why you cannot meet sooner and show earnest interest in maintaining the friendship\n- Ukrainians commonly refuse or protest things out of politeness. For example, it is the norm to decline an offer of food and wait for the person to offer it again. Therefore, if you say \u2018no\u2019 to a gesture, expect Ukrainians to persist in offering it again and again.\n- Repeat any offer multiple times to show that you are being sincere. It is expected that you will insist your help to show the gesture is genuine.\n- Blowing one\u2019s nose in public is considered bad manners.\n- It is impolite to yawn during conversations with others, or in public without covering your mouth.\n- Throwing away food or wasting food is frowned upon, especially bread. Ukrainians tend to repurpose leftovers (e.g. by leaving them outside for stray dogs or birds to eat).\n- It is inappropriate for strangers to approach someone else\u2019s child. Close contact or friendliness is frowned upon if you do not know the child (e.g. patting the head or shoulder).\n- It is polite to offer one\u2019s seat to an elderly person, pregnant woman or children in public spaces.\n- It is respectful to assist older people using transport. Ukrainians may offer their hand to help an elderly person get out of their seat, offer an arm for them to walk, and hold or open doors for them.\n- It is the norm for Ukrainian men to open doors for women and allow them to enter first. Ukrainian women may similarly expect men to perform this chivalry as a mark of politeness.\n- There is a large tipping culture in Ukraine. It is the norm to tip\u202fat least 10% after a meal.

Hosts often encourage guests to have second helpings and eat more even if they are full.\n- Try to taste all dishes on offer. Not eating very much can be perceived as rude or a sign that the food tastes bad.\n- It is important to wash your hands thoroughly before and after eating.\n- Food can either be served on a large plate set on the floor or on a table.\n- If the meal is on the floor, it is set on a thin plastic sheet (1m x 1m) to protect the carpet from the food. People sit cross-legged or kneel on one knee around the sheet. Keep your feet away from the cloth or plastic sheet.\n- When seated at a table, the most honoured seating position is in the middle of the table. Guests usually sit next to the head of the family. Do not take your seat until the eldest/most senior person has sat down.\n- Older restaurants may have two sections, one for men and one for families (where women and families are seated in a separate, partitioned arrangement). Newer restaurants usually have a mixed-gender open plan, that still provide the option for families to be segregated. A sign out front will indicate whether a restaurant is segregated. If there is no sign, it is usually mixed.\n- People only start eating once the host has said that it is time to begin. This is generally indicated when everyone says \u201cSahtain\u201d\u00a0(Good health) or \u201cBismallah\u201d\u00a0(in the name of God).\n- It is impolite to begin eating or drinking before the eldest/most senior person has started.\n- Saudi food generally does not require utensils to eat.

It refers to the quality of being thoughtful and considerate of others in such a way that the host can anticipate the needs of their guests or customers and adjust accordingly. Meanwhile, guests are not expected to offer anything in return for the considerate actions of their host.\n- Two common phrases used to indicate politeness are \u201cGomen nasai\u201d (\u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019) and \u201cSumimasen\u201d (\u2018Excuse me\u2019). It is considered proper etiquette to state these phrases when you have made a mistake or caused inconvenience. Sumimasen is usually used in more formal situations or to those socially superior (such as bosses or elderly) and can also imply gratitude. Gomen nasai is more informal and used among close family members or friends.\n- It is common in Japan for people to wear face masks, generally as a way to protect against colds. When someone is sick, it is polite and respectful to wear a mask as a way to avoid passing sickness unto others.\n- People usually walk on the left side of a path, especially in busy areas. Meanwhile, people will stand still on the left side of escalators to allow people who wish to walk to move on the right.\n- Japanese businesses often leave a small tray near the cash register for the customer to place their money. This ensures that the cashier does not need to directly come into contact with the customer. Disregarding the money tray and holding money out for the cashier to take is considered highly impolite.\n- It is considered rude to count the received change in front of a cashier. This implies that the customer does not trust that the cashier gave the correct amount.\n- Punctuality is extremely valued in Japan. Being on time for meetings, appointments, services and parties is expected. This expectation is carried through to services, such as public transport arriving exactly at the expected time. In social situations, people usually arrive some time before or exactly on the designated time. If you expect a delay, politely inform your Japanese counterpart.\n\nCountry: japan.\nPlease justify: Alice went to a local caf\u00e9 and, after ordering her coffee, she directly handed the money to the cashier instead of placing it on the small tray provided.

Therefore, one may find that an Afghan seeks to host you quite early on in your friendship.\n- An invitation is not always needed in order to visit one\u2019s house in Afghanistan. Neighbours and friends may pay each other visits without planning them first.\n- Verbal invitations to visit someone\u2019s home may be open-ended. For instance, an Afghan may say that the person is welcome to visit without giving specifics on when that time should be. The guest is then expected to be opportunistic and visit soon. It is advisable to make it your responsibility to organise the place and time of a visit after an Afghan has expressed interest in a friendship to avoid cross-cultural miscommunications.\n- Remove your shoes at the door when visiting a home.\n- Wait to be led through the house and shown where to sit.\n- Men and women are separated in most social visits. Men socialise in one room, and women in another. The female hosts generally bring food and refreshments to the men before leaving and joining the women again.\n- You may be seated on the floor with rugs and cushions. Sit crossed-legged if you can or otherwise in a position that is comfortable for you. Avoid sitting with your legs outstretched or with the soles of your feet facing another person.\n- It is customary to be offered tea and sweets as refreshment. It is very important to accept any refreshment (typically coffee/tea) as a mark of friendship. Non-acceptance would be perceived as highly offensive and could create misunderstanding even if you are simply not thirsty. Your cup of tea will be constantly filled until you indicate you\u2019ve had enough by covering it with your hand and thanking them.\n- As a guest, expect to be offered the best of everything (the best cut of meat, best silverware, etc.). Even the poorest family will go to great lengths to make sure a guest feels welcomed and has the best treatment able to be given. Try to graciously accept everything offered. Refusing an Afghan\u2019s generosity can be awkward.\n- Dogs are considered unclean in Afghanistan and are not meant to be let into areas where people pray (i.e. homes). Therefore, people rarely bring them inside their houses and it\u2019s not common to have them as pets. Some Afghans may be uncomfortable around them or afraid of them. Let your Afghan counterpart know in advance if you have a pet dog and keep it in a separate room or outside whilst they are visiting. Do not ask them to sit in a place where your dog has just been resting. For example, it would be seen as rude for you to tell your dog to get off the couch and then offer someone to sit in its place.\n\nCountry: afghanistan.\nPlease justify: During a visit to Alex's house, Jamie noticed that Alex's dog was lounging on the sofa. Without hesitation, Alex asked the dog to move and offered Jamie the spot to sit. Is what Alex did socially acceptable?.\n Choose from:'Yes', 'No', 'Neutral'",

A \u2018firag\u2019\u00a0is a gift given when someone is in mourning.\n- It is considered very rude not to return a gift. For example, if someone gives you a birthday present, you are expected to give them a present on their birthday of a similar standard.\n- Think about the other person\u2019s expectations when giving gifts. A gift is also seen as a debt that one will have to repay to a friend. Therefore, avoid giving very lavish or expensive gifts. This may embarrass the recipient if they cannot afford to give you the same standard of gift.\n- It is best not to give alcohol as a gift to Muslim or Protestant Ethiopians.\n- There may be an expectation upon the wealthy to offer money as a gift instead of another material item.\n\nCountry: ethiopia.\nPlease justify: During a visit to a friend's house, Sarah decided to present a gift.

It can also be good to bring something for children (such as sweets).\n- Gifts are also given on special occasions (e.g. marriages, births, building a new house, holidays and graduations), or when visiting someone who is sick. People usually wrap these gifts and put them in a nice bag.\n- Offer and receive gifts with two hands or the right hand only.\n- There is not always a clear process surrounding when gifts are opened. Traditionally, recipients open the gift in front of the giver to show appreciation. Some may send a message to the giver assuring that it will be used internally and they will not \u2018re-gift\u2019 it to others.\n- It is best not to give gifts that contain traces of alcohol or pork. Some Palestinians may drink alcohol. However, you should be assured of this fact before giving wine or liquor. It is more inappropriate to give alcohol to a woman.\n- Reciprocation is an important part of gift-giving.

Jewish dietary laws make a distinction between kosher (appropriate) and terefah (forbidden). Some foods are inherently kosher for consumption (such as fish that have both fins and scales) or inherently terefah (such as pork). However, other foods require a prescribed method of preparation and slaughter. If this method is not followed, the food is classified as forbidden.\n- One main Jewish dietary law is the separation of meat and dairy in the same meal. As such, some of Israel\u2019s cuisine does not contain dishes with both meat and dairy mixed together.\n- Some Jewish Israeli households will have separate cooking utensils to ensure the separation of meat and dairy.\n- Some Jewish Israelis may also wait several hours after eating a meat dish before consuming dairy to avoid the mixing of meat and dairy in their stomach. The waiting time may be up to nine hours.\n- Muslim families and restaurants observe Islamic dietary rules, which categorise foods as either allowed (halal) or forbidden (haram). Generally, all food and drink is\u00a0halal except for specifically forbidden cases (such as meat that has not been prepared and slaughtered according to\u00a0halal\u00a0standards, and pork).\n- Foods that abide by Jewish dietary laws are considered halal for Muslims.\n\nCountry: israel.\nPlease justify: Sarah invited a group of friends over to her house for dinner.

Some regard an unexpected guest as \u2018a guest from God\u2019 (Tanr\u0131 Misafiri).\n- Turks regularly offer invitations for others to join them (e.g. at their table) or have something of theirs. These gestures can come across as overly insistent or demanding to foreigners. However, consider that the former the invitation is, the more earnest and polite it is thought to be.\n- People are expected to be punctual to dinners and intimate gatherings. However, it is appropriate to be late to parties.\n- It is considered a nice gesture to bring sweets, flowers or presents for any children when visiting someone at their home. However, Turks are usually less concerned with what you bring and more interested in socialisation and conversation.\n- If you bring alcohol or food to a gathering, you are expected to share it.\n- Wear clean socks. You will often be expected to take off your shoes before entering a person\u2019s home. In some cases, you may be given a pair of slippers to wear instead.\n- Tea or coffee is offered and drunk at all occasions (commonly traditional Turkish tea or apple tea). It is usually served in a small tulip-shaped glass with sugar.

For example, it is common to find a blend of South American and Mexican cooking styles throughout the states closer to Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico. This includes items such as chilli and burritos, and relies heavily on shredded cheese and beans.\n- Wait until everyone has been seated and served before eating. The host often indicates when it is time to begin.\n- In some religious households, families may say a blessing before beginning to eat (known as saying \u2018grace\u2019).\n- In homes, dishes are usually passed around so that each person can get a share of food. If you find you do not want one of the dishes being passed around, it is acceptable to refuse by just continuing to pass it along.\n- Ask for someone to pass a dish to you instead of reaching across the table to grab it.\n- Napkins should be placed on your lap and kept there during the meal.\n- Americans use cutlery to eat food unless eating certain fast foods.\n- Hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right hand when cutting food. After cutting a bite-sized portion, the knife is placed down and the fork is swapped to the right hand to stab or scoop the food. Food is placed into the mouth with the fork tongs curving in the upward direction.\n- Note that this American norm of swapping the fork between hands differs from the European use of cutlery where the fork remains in the left hand and food is placed in the mouth with tongs facing downwards.\n- Do not cut up all the food on your plate at once. This is the way food is fed to young children.\n- The pause to swap the fork between hands to cut food slows down eating and allows for more conversation over the meal.\n- Americans have a distinct set of \u2018finger-foods\u2019 which are expected to be eaten with fingers, such as pizza, tacos or burgers.

This is a sign that you enjoyed the meal and is a compliment to the cook.\n- Guests may accept second servings when offered. This indicates they find the meal tasty and appreciate the hosts generosity.\n- Children will frequently be seated at a separate \u2018kids table\u2019, allowing adults to have more discreet conversations over meals. Children will sometimes be presented with a different menu selection of simpler foods and may eat at a different (usually earlier) time.\n- If children are seated at the same table as adults, they may ask to be excused from the table once they have finished eating.

It is acceptable to ask to have any left-over food repackaged to take home with you after eating out.\n- If eating the meal in someone\u2019s home, it is polite for guests to offer to help clear the table or wipe up dishes after the meal to reciprocate the host\u2019s generosity and show gratitude.\n\nCountry: united_states_of_america.\nPlease justify: At a friend's house, Emily decided to eat her slice of pizza with a fork and knife, cutting it into small, bite-sized pieces.

Plans are often discussed loosely in everyday conversation to accommodate for delays (e.g.\u00a0 \u201cCome around seven\u201d or \u201cLet\u2019s\u202fmeet at about five\u201d). It is common for Ukrainians to arrive 15 to 30 minutes later than the agreed time.\n- If an important person or conversation takes longer than expected, Ukrainians tend to prioritise the person over the time.\n- Uphold any promises you make to see your Ukrainian counterpart sooner rather than later. Ukrainians tend to follow up on invitations to see friends and acquaintances quite quickly (often the same or following day from when it was offered). If you make a passing suggestion to meet, it will be expected this is organised in a timely fashion.\n- If you are unable to meet within a week or suggest a date in a few weeks time, Ukrainians may misinterpret this as a signal that you do not actually want to see them. Therefore, it important to clearly explain the circumstances as to why you cannot meet sooner and show earnest interest in maintaining the friendship\n- Ukrainians commonly refuse or protest things out of politeness. For example, it is the norm to decline an offer of food and wait for the person to offer it again. Therefore, if you say \u2018no\u2019 to a gesture, expect Ukrainians to persist in offering it again and again.\n- Repeat any offer multiple times to show that you are being sincere. It is expected that you will insist your help to show the gesture is genuine.\n- Blowing one\u2019s nose in public is considered bad manners.\n- It is impolite to yawn during conversations with others, or in public without covering your mouth.\n- Throwing away food or wasting food is frowned upon, especially bread. Ukrainians tend to repurpose leftovers (e.g. by leaving them outside for stray dogs or birds to eat).\n- It is inappropriate for strangers to approach someone else\u2019s child. Close contact or friendliness is frowned upon if you do not know the child (e.g. patting the head or shoulder).\n- It is polite to offer one\u2019s seat to an elderly person, pregnant woman or children in public spaces.\n- It is respectful to assist older people using transport. Ukrainians may offer their hand to help an elderly person get out of their seat, offer an arm for them to walk, and hold or open doors for them.\n- It is the norm for Ukrainian men to open doors for women and allow them to enter first. Ukrainian women may similarly expect men to perform this chivalry as a mark of politeness.\n- There is a large tipping culture in Ukraine. It is the norm to tip\u202fat least 10% after a meal. Some restaurants may include the tip in the total bill.\n- It is uncommon to split the bill\u202fevenly in social scenarios. Typically, the person who invited people to the meal pays for the total bill or each person\u202fpays for their own order.\n\nCountry: ukraine.\nPlease justify: During a gathering at a friend's house, Michael noticed that Sara seemed cold.

For example, southern-style cooking (often called \"American comfort food\") includes dishes such as fried chicken, collard greens and cornbread.\n- Cuisines may also differ depending on the dominant migration populations in the region. For example, it is common to find a blend of South American and Mexican cooking styles throughout the states closer to Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico. This includes items such as chilli and burritos, and relies heavily on shredded cheese and beans.\n- Wait until everyone has been seated and served before eating. The host often indicates when it is time to begin.\n- In some religious households, families may say a blessing before beginning to eat (known as saying \u2018grace\u2019).\n- In homes, dishes are usually passed around so that each person can get a share of food. If you find you do not want one of the dishes being passed around, it is acceptable to refuse by just continuing to pass it along.\n- Ask for someone to pass a dish to you instead of reaching across the table to grab it.\n- Napkins should be placed on your lap and kept there during the meal.\n- Americans use cutlery to eat food unless eating certain fast foods.\n- Hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right hand when cutting food. After cutting a bite-sized portion, the knife is placed down and the fork is swapped to the right hand to stab or scoop the food. Food is placed into the mouth with the fork tongs curving in the upward direction.\n- Note that this American norm of swapping the fork between hands differs from the European use of cutlery where the fork remains in the left hand and food is placed in the mouth with tongs facing downwards.\n- Do not cut up all the food on your plate at once. This is the way food is fed to young children.\n- The pause to swap the fork between hands to cut food slows down eating and allows for more conversation over the meal.\n- Americans have a distinct set of \u2018finger-foods\u2019 which are expected to be eaten with fingers, such as pizza, tacos or burgers. They may think it is strange or unusual if you eat pizza with a fork or cut a burrito into smaller bites.\n- It is polite to offer to refill other people\u2019s drinks or pass them dishes at the table.\n- It is rude to eat with your mouth open, lick your plate, bowl or knife, talk while there is still food in your mouth, burp out loud, or lick food off your fingers.\n- It is acceptable to mop up any remaining food in your plate/bowl with bread that was served as part of the meal. This is a sign that you enjoyed the meal and is a compliment to the cook.\n- Guests may accept second servings when offered. This indicates they find the meal tasty and appreciate the hosts generosity.\n- Children will frequently be seated at a separate \u2018kids table\u2019, allowing adults to have more discreet conversations over meals. Children will sometimes be presented with a different menu selection of simpler foods and may eat at a different (usually earlier) time.\n- If children are seated at the same table as adults, they may ask to be excused from the table once they have finished eating. This is a polite way of exiting if they do not wish to sit quietly or join in the adult conversation.\n- American restaurants tend to serve quite large portion sizes. It is acceptable to ask to have any left-over food repackaged to take home with you after eating out.\n- If eating the meal in someone\u2019s home, it is polite for guests to offer to help clear the table or wipe up dishes after the meal to reciprocate the host\u2019s generosity and show gratitude.\n\nCountry: united_states_of_america.\nPlease justify: During dinner at her friend's house, Emily was served a significantly large portion of lasagna.

It is considered to be a great offence to the host as it implies they did not prepare enough food for everyone.\n- Tongan families eat meals together whenever possible.\n- Most meals are eaten on woven mats on the floor.\n- The traditional method of eating is to use one's hands, but some households may use utensils.\n- Standing while eating or drinking is considered to be poor etiquette.\n- It is common to say a prayer or \u2018Grace\u2019 before eating in most Tongan households. This is done at every meal.\n- Conversation is kept to a minimum while people are eating.\n- When guests are present, a few selected family members eat with them. Everyone else, including children, usually sits elsewhere for their meal.\n- Hosts usually indicate to guests where to sit, which is generally in the middle section of the table or mat so that they can converse with everyone with more ease.\n- Guests are served first and typically set the pace of the meal. This means that the guest should be aware that no one will begin eating until the guest does and no one will finish before the guest.\n- Take everything you plan to eat before you begin as it is traditionally seen as rude to take a second serving.\n- On Sundays and special occasions, Tongans usually cook their meals in an\u00a0umu\u00a0(a type of underground oven).\n- A popular drink during formal occasions is kava, a drink with sedative and anaesthetic properties similar to alcohol. Usually, only men are permitted to drink kava, but females (usually the eldest single daughter or niece of the family) are expected to serve the drink.\n\nCountry: tonga.\nPlease justify: During a dinner at her friend's house, Emily decided to stand up while eating her meal, as she was in a hurry and thought it would save time.

        "instruction": "### Visiting\n- It is not always common to entertain and have social events in people\u2019s homes, in part due to the small size of most Japanese houses. To be invited into someone\u2019s home is seen as a big honour.\n- An important distinction in Japanese homes is between the inside and outside. In many houses, there is a small space between the main door and the rest of the home that acts as an intermediate space. This entrance area is known as a \u2018genkan\u2019. The size of the\u00a0genkan\u00a0is usually proportionate to the size of the house; small houses will have a narrow\u00a0genkan\u00a0while larger houses will have a more spacious\u00a0genkan.\n- Traditionally, the main indoor space is slightly elevated and has separate flooring from the\u00a0genkan.\n- Importantly, the\u00a0genkan\u00a0is where people remove their shoes before entering the home. This is usually done as a way to avoid bringing dirt from outside into the house. It is extremely impolite to step foot past the\u00a0genkan\u00a0with outdoor shoes.\n- Outdoor shoes should be removed slowly, rather than kicked off the feet.\n- Once someone has removed their outdoor shoes, it is common practice to place the shoes on a provided shoe rack or to point the shoes towards the door.\n- Hosts will often provide guests with indoor slippers to wear while visiting the house.\n- Indoor slippers are usually worn all throughout the house except for spaces in some more traditional homes that have\u00a0tatami\u00a0mats (a type of flooring made of woven straw).\n- Some hosts may have separate slippers worn only when using the bathroom or toilet.\n- People nearly always bring a gift when visiting another person\u2019s home (see Gift Giving below for appropriate gifts).\n- Hosts usually indicate to guests where to sit when they enter a room.\n- The most important guest is offered the most honoured seat (kamiza), which is the seat furthest from the entrance.\n- The least important person present (usually the host) sits in the least honoured seat (shimoza), which is the seat closest to the entrance.\n- If the host does not indicate where to sit, the most appropriate choice is to sit closest to the entrance to demonstrate humility.\n- Some houses and restaurants in Japan follow the tradition of sitting around a low table. Sometimes, people will sit on the floor directly or on floor cushions. However, some places have a hole under the table where people can sit and hang their legs similar to if they were sitting on a chair.\n- When sitting on the floor, there are a couple of ways people are usually expected to sit. The formal Japanese sitting position is known as \u2018seiza\u2019.\u00a0In this position, people sit with their legs tucked under their thighs while resting their bottom on the heels and maintaining a straight back. Women usually keep their knees together, while men have their knees slightly apart.\n- In casual situations, men usually sit on the floor with their legs crossed, while women sit with both legs to one side.\n\nCountry: japan.\nPlease justify: During a visit to Mark's house, Sarah entered and immediately walked into the living room with her shoes still on.

For example, there is often an expectation that the guest will accept what is offered. If you refuse something, it may be seen as a token protest made out of politeness, and thus, a Lebanese person may insist that you receive what is given instead of accepting your refusal. This can lead to awkward situations in which an Australian can feel the offer is being forced upon them.

It is advisable to abstain from drinking alcohol altogether if you are hosted by Saudi Arabians to avoid potential embarrassment or offence.\n- Pork is also prohibited in Islam. Do not serve food containing pork or pork byproducts (e.g. gelatine) to your Saudi counterpart.\n- It is polite to avoid eating, drinking or smoking in front of a Muslim during the daylight hours of the fasting month of Ramadan. In Saudi Arabia, it is considered disrespectful to engage in these activities in public.\n- Saudis often prepare more food than what their guests will be able to feasibly eat. Hosts often encourage guests to have second helpings and eat more even if they are full.\n- Try to taste all dishes on offer. Not eating very much can be perceived as rude or a sign that the food tastes bad.\n- It is important to wash your hands thoroughly before and after eating.\n- Food can either be served on a large plate set on the floor or on a table.\n- If the meal is on the floor, it is set on a thin plastic sheet (1m x 1m) to protect the carpet from the food. People sit cross-legged or kneel on one knee around the sheet. Keep your feet away from the cloth or plastic sheet.\n- When seated at a table, the most honoured seating position is in the middle of the table. Guests usually sit next to the head of the family. Do not take your seat until the eldest/most senior person has sat down.\n- Older restaurants may have two sections, one for men and one for families (where women and families are seated in a separate, partitioned arrangement). Newer restaurants usually have a mixed-gender open plan, that still provide the option for families to be segregated. A sign out front will indicate whether a restaurant is segregated. If there is no sign, it is usually mixed.\n- People only start eating once the host has said that it is time to begin. This is generally indicated when everyone says \u201cSahtain\u201d\u00a0(Good health) or \u201cBismallah\u201d\u00a0(in the name of God).\n- It is impolite to begin eating or drinking before the eldest/most senior person has started.\n- Saudi food generally does not require utensils to eat. People use their right hand, scooping with the fingers.\n- Use the right hand to serve and pass any food or dish, in accordance with Islamic custom. The left hand is considered unclean and shouldn\u2019t make direct contact with food.\n- When eating rice, it is normal to form the rice into a small ball before placing it in the mouth. If seated on the floor, rice may drop onto the plastic sheet whilst moving it from the dish to your mouth. This is normal and socially acceptable.\n- Meat is stripped from the bone with the right hand. It is polite to offer other people separate bits of stripped meat.\n- Flat bread is a staple in almost all meals.\n- When the meal is finished, guests can say \u201cDaimah\u201d,\u00a0meaning \u2018may there always be plenty of food on your table\u2019.\n- The main meal may be followed by more tea or coffee and some sweets.\n- Be aware that the time for networking and socialisation comes before the meal is eaten. Once the food has been eaten, guests generally leave very quickly after. Some Saudi men often leave very quickly after the meal is finished.\n- Thank the host directly before getting up from the table.\n\nCountry: saudi_arabia.\nPlease justify: Alice was visiting a friend's house during the month of fasting.

Thus, there are a number of practices one should observe when with a French counterpart.\n- You are expected to pass dishes around and to hold a dish so your neighbour can retrieve some of the meal.\n- When one begins a meal, they typically say \u201cbon app\u00e9tit\u201d\u00a0(enjoy your meal).\n- Dinner guests should not open their mouth or talk when eating, and should gently wipe their mouth after taking a drink.\n- When someone finishes their meal, the fork and knife are placed side by side on the plate on the right or in the centre of the plate.\n- At a restaurant, guests are generally not expected to share the bill.\n- There are three main meals throughout the day: le petit d\u00e9jeuner (breakfast),\u00a0le d\u00e9jeuner\u00a0(lunch) and le d\u00eener\u00a0(dinner). The largest meal of the day is dinner, and is often eaten with the family.\n- Meals comprise different courses, typically an entr\u00e9e, main, some cheese, and dessert. The French take their time eating each course of their meal.\n- Another common type of meal enjoyed is known as the \u2018ap\u00e9ro\u2019 (also known as \u2018l\u2019ap\u00e9ritif\u2019), which is a pre-dinner drink with finger foods and filled with conversations. The length of time varies from a short 30 minute meal to a 3 hour affair. If you are invited to an ap\u00e9ro, it is best to bring something gourmet (rather than a bag of chips/crisps). For example, tapenade, olives, fresh bread, or cheese would be appropriate. Additionally, the last piece of food at an ap\u00e9ro is usually left for some time until someone politely asks others if they may eat it.\n- Wine plays an important role in French cuisine. It is often served with meals, and people tend to comment on the flavours and quality of the wine they are drinking. Typically, one begins by smelling the wine, then taking a sip and tasting the flavours for a few seconds before swallowing. Practices relating to wine become more important the higher the quality of the wine. Finally, if you do not want any more wine, leave your current glass mostly full to indicate this to your host. Failing to respect wine-related etiquette is viewed as lacking manners.\n- It is generally frowned upon to leave food on a plate, particularly when in someone\u2019s home. Each course of a meal tends to take time to make. Thus, one shows appreciation for the efforts of the person cooking through the enjoyment and completion of the meal.\n\nCountry: france.\nPlease justify: At a dinner party, Jamie was among the guests at Sarah's house.

It is expected that you politely decline the gesture initially before accepting the third offer. This exchange is polite as the insistence to extend the invitation shows hospitality and the initial refusal to accept shows humbleness and that one is not greedy.\n- Be sure to offer everything multiple times in return. If you only offer something once, a Sudanese person may respond, \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay\u201d, out of modesty and politeness even though they meant to accept the second offer.\n- Be careful when you compliment an item in a Sudanese person\u2019s house, as they may feel compelled to offer it to you as a gift. If they try to give it to you, insist that you appreciate their gesture but do not want to take it. A Sudanese person is likely to offer the object out of politeness, and if you accept, they may end up giving you something they wished to keep.\n- There is a strong belief in the evil eye in Sudan\u00a0whereby one\u2019s misfortune is caused by another\u2019s envy, sometimes taking the form of a curse.\u00a0Do not compliment something more than once or continue to praise it once you have acknowledged it.

For example, it is common to find a blend of South American and Mexican cooking styles throughout the states closer to Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico. This includes items such as chilli and burritos, and relies heavily on shredded cheese and beans.\n- Wait until everyone has been seated and served before eating. The host often indicates when it is time to begin.\n- In some religious households, families may say a blessing before beginning to eat (known as saying \u2018grace\u2019).\n- In homes, dishes are usually passed around so that each person can get a share of food. If you find you do not want one of the dishes being passed around, it is acceptable to refuse by just continuing to pass it along.\n- Ask for someone to pass a dish to you instead of reaching across the table to grab it.\n- Napkins should be placed on your lap and kept there during the meal.\n- Americans use cutlery to eat food unless eating certain fast foods.\n- Hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right hand when cutting food. After cutting a bite-sized portion, the knife is placed down and the fork is swapped to the right hand to stab or scoop the food. Food is placed into the mouth with the fork tongs curving in the upward direction.\n- Note that this American norm of swapping the fork between hands differs from the European use of cutlery where the fork remains in the left hand and food is placed in the mouth with tongs facing downwards.\n- Do not cut up all the food on your plate at once. This is the way food is fed to young children.\n- The pause to swap the fork between hands to cut food slows down eating and allows for more conversation over the meal.\n- Americans have a distinct set of \u2018finger-foods\u2019 which are expected to be eaten with fingers, such as pizza, tacos or burgers. They may think it is strange or unusual if you eat pizza with a fork or cut a burrito into smaller bites.\n- It is polite to offer to refill other people\u2019s drinks or pass them dishes at the table.\n- It is rude to eat with your mouth open, lick your plate, bowl or knife, talk while there is still food in your mouth, burp out loud, or lick food off your fingers.\n- It is acceptable to mop up any remaining food in your plate/bowl with bread that was served as part of the meal. This is a sign that you enjoyed the meal and is a compliment to the cook.\n- Guests may accept second servings when offered. This indicates they find the meal tasty and appreciate the hosts generosity.\n- Children will frequently be seated at a separate \u2018kids table\u2019, allowing adults to have more discreet conversations over meals. Children will sometimes be presented with a different menu selection of simpler foods and may eat at a different (usually earlier) time.\n- If children are seated at the same table as adults, they may ask to be excused from the table once they have finished eating. This is a polite way of exiting if they do not wish to sit quietly or join in the adult conversation.\n- American restaurants tend to serve quite large portion sizes. It is acceptable to ask to have any left-over food repackaged to take home with you after eating out.\n- If eating the meal in someone\u2019s home, it is polite for guests to offer to help clear the table or wipe up dishes after the meal to reciprocate the host\u2019s generosity and show gratitude.\n\nCountry: united_states_of_america.\nPlease justify: At a dinner party at a friend's house, Chris was particularly hungry.

The waiting time may be up to nine hours.\n- Muslim families and restaurants observe Islamic dietary rules, which categorise foods as either allowed (halal) or forbidden (haram).

Sometimes, people will sit on the floor directly or on floor cushions.

Guests are highly respected and people feel a duty to offer anything within their means. Even if a family has no food to provide a guest, they are expected to at least offer water.\n- Guests are always offered refreshments, typically tea. It is very important to accept any drink offered as a mark of friendship. Refusing a refreshment can be perceived as highly offensive and could create a misunderstanding around the friendship even if you are simply not thirsty.\n- Close friends, family and neighbours may visit one another frequently unannounced. A Somali may face some adjustment in having to arrange a time to meet.\n- Social visiting and hosting holds great importance in building and mending relations among friends and family members. Not visiting someone for a long period of time is considered a sign of the relationship\u2019s insignificance. People may also choose not to visit someone on purpose to indirectly reveal that they are angry/offended at something the person has done.\n- Be mindful that a Somali person\u2019s home is also their private place for prayer. Therefore, it is important to be clean and respectful.\n- Remove your shoes when entering someone\u2019s home unless advised otherwise.\n- Dogs are considered unclean in Somalia and are generally not allowed in areas where people pray (i.e. homes). Therefore, people rarely bring them inside their houses in Somalia and it\u2019s not common to have them as pets. Let your Somali counterpart know in advance if you have a pet dog. Do not ask them to sit in a place where your dog has just been resting. For example, it would be seen as rude for you to tell your dog to get off the couch and then offer someone to sit in its place.\n- Often an entire family will come to a household and visit at once. Men and women will usually converse separately whilst children play in an area that does not disturb adults.\n- Sometimes women will visit one another at home alone. If men want to socialise together, they often go to tea shops.\n- In Somalia, many households have two living rooms (one for each gender) where people socialise separately.\n- Visits can go on for hours. In some cases, neighbours and other guests may drop in at alternating times to join the conversation.\n- Expect goodbyes to be prolonged as people farewell everyone individually and the host walks you outside.

        "instruction": "### Gift Giving\n- Gift giving (z\u014dt\u014d) is quite popular in Japan. Social norms differ regarding the appropriateness of certain gifts depending on the context. The general theme underpinning gift giving practices in Japan is that there is a reciprocal cycle of obligation and gratitude. Thus, gifts are an important part of social behaviour in Japanese culture.\n- Gifts are typically given to commemorate births, graduations, house visits, weddings and anniversaries. Traditionally, gifts were not given during Christmas or for birthdays, but this is becoming much more common in Japan.\n- There are also two popular gift giving seasons in Japan that coincide with major dates of significance. The first is\u00a0Ch\u016bgen,\u00a0which occurs around the Obon festival in July, and the second is\u00a0Seibo,\u00a0which occurs near the end of the year. Department stores in Japan often sell gifts specifically for\u00a0Ch\u016bgen\u00a0and\u00a0Seibo\u00a0that are already appropriately wrapped.\n- During\u00a0Ch\u016bgen,\u00a0people usually give gifts to their social superior. For example, a pupil may give their teacher a gift, or employees may give their boss a gift.\n- During\u00a0Seibo,\u00a0gifts are usually given as a way to express gratitude to those who are important or who have helped the individual in their life or business. It is often a way to recognise favours received throughout the year.\n- Proper etiquette is to give and receive a gift with both hands.\n- When giving a gift to an individual, it is usually done in private. Gifts given to a group are usually placed in a communal area so that everyone can share the gift.\n- People tend to wait until they are indoors to give a gift. Sometimes, flowers or plants are given outside.\n- Depending on the context, it is not uncommon for people to initially refuse the gift at first. The giver then insists the recipient takes the gift. However, refusing a gift from someone who is higher ranking is generally considered rude.\n- It is inappropriate for the giver to exaggerate or boast about the gift they are giving. Rather, people tend to de-emphasise the worth of a gift.\n- Popular gifts given in Japan include flowers, plants, edible gifts (e.g. food gift baskets, chocolate, fruits, savoury snacks), alcohol, stationery, small household items (e.g. hand towels) or clothing accessories (e.g. hats or scarves). People often appreciate gifts that are not from their current location.\n- The way a gift is presented is often considered as important as the gift itself. There are a number of customs and norms relating to how a gift should be wrapped depending on the situation. Generally, gifts are wrapped and presented nicely, no matter the gift. It is also acceptable to give gifts in a nice gift bag.\n- Monetary gifts are usually given in a decorative envelope. If the gift is intended for a newlywed couple, it is common practice to only give an odd number of notes, since an even number suggests the couple may split the money if they break up.\n- It is common to find small pre-wrapped gifts in many transit places in Japan, such as airports and train stations. These may be snacks, treats, bath products or souvenirs. Such gifts are known as \u2018omiyage\u2019\u00a0or \u2018temiyage\u2019\u00a0depending on the context. The general underlying idea is that the gift is produced from a city, town, region or country different from where the gift is given.\n- Omiyage\u00a0is often translated as \u2018souvenir\u2019 but generally refers to a local product to be given as a gift. These types of gifts are usually for travellers to bring back home to family, friends and coworkers to show thoughtfulness whilst away on travel.\n- Temiyage\u00a0refers to gifts given by visitors as a way to show appreciation. For example, when visiting someone\u2019s home in Japan, a foreign visitor will give a gift from their own country.\n- It is common for the receiver to thank the giver by writing them a letter or calling them on the phone. Depending on the occasion, it is also common for people to give a small gift in return (known as\u00a0okaeshi, a 'thank-you gift'). This type of gift is usually given after a funeral, illness, wedding or birth. The value of the gift is typically half of the value of the original gift.\n- There are several gifts that are inappropriate to give, unless the recipient specifically requests the item. It is usually inappropriate to give gifts relating to fire when visiting someone\u2019s home (such as an ashtray, heater or lighter). Sharp gifts such as scissors or knives are also inappropriate as they symbolise a wish to sever a relationship. Avoid giving lilies, lotus flowers, camellias or any white flower as these are usually associated with funerals.\n- Items that predominantly display the numbers four or nine are generally considered inappropriate (see Other Considerations). For example, it would be inappropriate to give someone four boxes of biscuits, or a comb that has nine teeth.\n\nCountry: japan.\nPlease justify: Alice visited her friend Ben's house for the first time and brought along a small plant as a gift.

However, they tend to prefer to socialise at public places (e.g. bars and cafes) rather than in their homes. Therefore, try not to be offended if you are not invited to a Spaniard\u2019s house for a long time.\n- It is not essential to bring things when visiting Spaniards. People are generally more interested in your company and conversation than what gifts you bring.\n- Expect meals to be served at later times. Dinner is usually eaten between 9pm and 11:30pm.\n- Do not leave immediately after a meal is finished. It is expected that guests will stay for \u2018la sobremesa\u2019. This is the time spent after the meal that involves relaxed, fun conversations over coffee or alcoholic drinks.\n- In many cases, the sobremesa is the main point of the visit, extending far into the morning.\n- You can usually gauge when a host is ready for you to leave their home when they stop offering you more drinks.\n- People may not wish to give an outright announcement when the night is at its end. Instead, people may talk about having \u201cla penultima\u201d \u2013 one last drink for the road or \u2018the last but one\u2019.

A plate wiped clean may imply there was an insufficient amount of food.\n- After finishing a meal, utensils are placed together on the plate.\n- It is rude to transfer food from a communal plate with one\u2019s personal spoon.

It is common for Ukrainians to arrive 15 to 30 minutes later than the agreed time.\n- If an important person or conversation takes longer than expected, Ukrainians tend to prioritise the person over the time.\n- Uphold any promises you make to see your Ukrainian counterpart sooner rather than later. Ukrainians tend to follow up on invitations to see friends and acquaintances quite quickly (often the same or following day from when it was offered). If you make a passing suggestion to meet, it will be expected this is organised in a timely fashion.\n- If you are unable to meet within a week or suggest a date in a few weeks time, Ukrainians may misinterpret this as a signal that you do not actually want to see them. Therefore, it important to clearly explain the circumstances as to why you cannot meet sooner and show earnest interest in maintaining the friendship\n- Ukrainians commonly refuse or protest things out of politeness. For example, it is the norm to decline an offer of food and wait for the person to offer it again. Therefore, if you say \u2018no\u2019 to a gesture, expect Ukrainians to persist in offering it again and again.\n- Repeat any offer multiple times to show that you are being sincere. It is expected that you will insist your help to show the gesture is genuine.\n- Blowing one\u2019s nose in public is considered bad manners.\n- It is impolite to yawn during conversations with others, or in public without covering your mouth.\n- Throwing away food or wasting food is frowned upon, especially bread. Ukrainians tend to repurpose leftovers (e.g. by leaving them outside for stray dogs or birds to eat).\n- It is inappropriate for strangers to approach someone else\u2019s child. Close contact or friendliness is frowned upon if you do not know the child (e.g. patting the head or shoulder).\n- It is polite to offer one\u2019s seat to an elderly person, pregnant woman or children in public spaces.\n- It is respectful to assist older people using transport. Ukrainians may offer their hand to help an elderly person get out of their seat, offer an arm for them to walk, and hold or open doors for them.\n- It is the norm for Ukrainian men to open doors for women and allow them to enter first. Ukrainian women may similarly expect men to perform this chivalry as a mark of politeness.\n- There is a large tipping culture in Ukraine. It is the norm to tip\u202fat least 10% after a meal. Some restaurants may include the tip in the total bill.\n- It is uncommon to split the bill\u202fevenly in social scenarios.

Thus, there are a number of practices one should observe when with a French counterpart.\n- You are expected to pass dishes around and to hold a dish so your neighbour can retrieve some of the meal.\n- When one begins a meal, they typically say \u201cbon app\u00e9tit\u201d\u00a0(enjoy your meal).\n- Dinner guests should not open their mouth or talk when eating, and should gently wipe their mouth after taking a drink.\n- When someone finishes their meal, the fork and knife are placed side by side on the plate on the right or in the centre of the plate.\n- At a restaurant, guests are generally not expected to share the bill.\n- There are three main meals throughout the day: le petit d\u00e9jeuner (breakfast),\u00a0le d\u00e9jeuner\u00a0(lunch) and le d\u00eener\u00a0(dinner). The largest meal of the day is dinner, and is often eaten with the family.\n- Meals comprise different courses, typically an entr\u00e9e, main, some cheese, and dessert. The French take their time eating each course of their meal.\n- Another common type of meal enjoyed is known as the \u2018ap\u00e9ro\u2019 (also known as \u2018l\u2019ap\u00e9ritif\u2019), which is a pre-dinner drink with finger foods and filled with conversations. The length of time varies from a short 30 minute meal to a 3 hour affair. If you are invited to an ap\u00e9ro, it is best to bring something gourmet (rather than a bag of chips/crisps). For example, tapenade, olives, fresh bread, or cheese would be appropriate. Additionally, the last piece of food at an ap\u00e9ro is usually left for some time until someone politely asks others if they may eat it.\n- Wine plays an important role in French cuisine. It is often served with meals, and people tend to comment on the flavours and quality of the wine they are drinking. Typically, one begins by smelling the wine, then taking a sip and tasting the flavours for a few seconds before swallowing. Practices relating to wine become more important the higher the quality of the wine. Finally, if you do not want any more wine, leave your current glass mostly full to indicate this to your host. Failing to respect wine-related etiquette is viewed as lacking manners.\n- It is generally frowned upon to leave food on a plate, particularly when in someone\u2019s home. Each course of a meal tends to take time to make. Thus, one shows appreciation for the efforts of the person cooking through the enjoyment and completion of the meal.\n\nCountry: france.\nPlease justify: At a dinner party hosted by her friend, Sarah, Emily took a moment to evaluate the wine's aroma before taking a sip.

For example, it is common to find a blend of South American and Mexican cooking styles throughout the states closer to Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico. This includes items such as chilli and burritos, and relies heavily on shredded cheese and beans.\n- Wait until everyone has been seated and served before eating.

This is the way food is fed to young children.\n- The pause to swap the fork between hands to cut food slows down eating and allows for more conversation over the meal.\n- Americans have a distinct set of \u2018finger-foods\u2019 which are expected to be eaten with fingers, such as pizza, tacos or burgers.

Therefore, try not to be offended if you are not invited to a Spaniard\u2019s house for a long time.\n- It is not essential to bring things when visiting Spaniards. People are generally more interested in your company and conversation than what gifts you bring.\n- Expect meals to be served at later times. Dinner is usually eaten between 9pm and 11:30pm.\n- Do not leave immediately after a meal is finished. It is expected that guests will stay for \u2018la sobremesa\u2019. This is the time spent after the meal that involves relaxed, fun conversations over coffee or alcoholic drinks.\n- In many cases, the sobremesa is the main point of the visit, extending far into the morning.\n- You can usually gauge when a host is ready for you to leave their home when they stop offering you more drinks.\n- People may not wish to give an outright announcement when the night is at its end. Instead, people may talk about having \u201cla penultima\u201d \u2013 one last drink for the road or \u2018the last but one\u2019.

For example, to reflect deep gratitude for a favour someone has done for you, you may give them sports tickets or take them to an expensive restaurant.\n- It is polite to bring a small gift as a gesture of appreciation when invited to someone\u2019s house or a dinner party (e.g. wine, chocolate).\n- It is expected that the receiver gives effusive praise of a gift, regardless of its size, appeal, monetary worth, etc. It is common for the receiver to state how they will intend to use the gift as a gesture of genuine appreciation.\n- Complaints or negative comments about a gift are considered extremely rude, even if the gift was broken, unusual or inappropriate. Commenting that you already have the same item is also considered rude.\n- It is insulting to give away, re-gift or throw away a gift.

Do not arrive unannounced or bring friends and family along unless you have asked to include them beforehand, or they have indicated that you can arrive unannounced. However, M\u0101ori greatly value hospitality and family connection so will generally be more accepting if you wish to bring family members or close friends along with you.\n- When organising a visit, ask the host \u201cWhat can I bring?\u201d ahead of time. They may wish for you to contribute food or drink.\n- If a host asks you to \u2018bring a plate\u2019, this is a request to bring a dish or platter of food to share with other guests.

Arriving more than 10 minutes early to someone\u2019s house may inconvenience the host. On the other hand, being more than 5\u201310 minutes late without giving someone forewarning is considered disrespectful.\n- It is usually okay to be 10\u201315 minutes late to a small gathering of people. Being late is more acceptable when attending parties and large social gatherings.\n- After knocking, wait to be invited in. If you have an established relationship with the person and there is no response, it may be appropriate to knock again and enter cautiously by saying \u201cHello?\u201d to announce your arrival.\n- Offer to remove your shoes before entering a home, especially in M\u0101ori households.\n- If eating at someone\u2019s home, offer to help your host prepare and clean up after the meal.\n- If the host asks whether you would like more food, it is okay to politely decline or accept depending on how hungry you are. Neither is considered rude.\n- Lay your knife and fork down on the plate together to indicate that you have finished your meal.

Therefore, one may find that an Afghan seeks to host you quite early on in your friendship.\n- An invitation is not always needed in order to visit one\u2019s house in Afghanistan. Neighbours and friends may pay each other visits without planning them first.\n- Verbal invitations to visit someone\u2019s home may be open-ended. For instance, an Afghan may say that the person is welcome to visit without giving specifics on when that time should be. The guest is then expected to be opportunistic and visit soon. It is advisable to make it your responsibility to organise the place and time of a visit after an Afghan has expressed interest in a friendship to avoid cross-cultural miscommunications.\n- Remove your shoes at the door when visiting a home.\n- Wait to be led through the house and shown where to sit.\n- Men and women are separated in most social visits. Men socialise in one room, and women in another. The female hosts generally bring food and refreshments to the men before leaving and joining the women again.\n- You may be seated on the floor with rugs and cushions. Sit crossed-legged if you can or otherwise in a position that is comfortable for you. Avoid sitting with your legs outstretched or with the soles of your feet facing another person.\n- It is customary to be offered tea and sweets as refreshment. It is very important to accept any refreshment (typically coffee/tea) as a mark of friendship. Non-acceptance would be perceived as highly offensive and could create misunderstanding even if you are simply not thirsty. Your cup of tea will be constantly filled until you indicate you\u2019ve had enough by covering it with your hand and thanking them.\n- As a guest, expect to be offered the best of everything (the best cut of meat, best silverware, etc.). Even the poorest family will go to great lengths to make sure a guest feels welcomed and has the best treatment able to be given. Try to graciously accept everything offered. Refusing an Afghan\u2019s generosity can be awkward.\n- Dogs are considered unclean in Afghanistan and are not meant to be let into areas where people pray (i.e. homes). Therefore, people rarely bring them inside their houses and it\u2019s not common to have them as pets. Some Afghans may be uncomfortable around them or afraid of them. Let your Afghan counterpart know in advance if you have a pet dog and keep it in a separate room or outside whilst they are visiting. Do not ask them to sit in a place where your dog has just been resting. For example, it would be seen as rude for you to tell your dog to get off the couch and then offer someone to sit in its place.\n\nCountry: afghanistan.\nPlease justify: During a visit to her friend Chris's house, Sarah was offered a cup of tea and some sweets by Chris's family.

This custom is tied to Islamic principles that prescribe the left hand should be used for removal of dirt and for cleaning. It should not be used for functions such as waving, eating or passing items. Therefore, one should gesture, touch people or offer items using both hands together. Using the one hand alone can seem too informal, but if doing so, use the right.\n- Tipping is common in Saudi Arabia, but it is not routine. It is also not required if a service charge is already included in the bill. Saudis usually tip expatriate service people and individual services in hotels despite the overall service charge. For example, it is appropriate to leave $1-2USD for a porter or housekeeper.\n- Punctuality depends on the priority of the occasion. Saudi Arabians generally have a more relaxed approach to time-keeping in casual settings. People do not adhere to tight schedules and are quite tolerant of lateness when meeting with friends. However, punctuality is expected and adhered to in professional settings (see Business Culture).\n- It is considered rude to check the time whilst in conversation with someone or at a social gathering. Time spent with friends is considered time well spent.\n- Ask permission before taking anyone\u2019s photo or posting it online, especially if they are a woman.\n- Avoid sitting in any position that allows one\u2019s shoe to face another person. This is considered insulting. Similarly, it is inappropriate to cross your legs when facing someone.\n- Try to avoid situations in which you will be left alone with a member of the opposite gender (e.g. elevators, cars). If a woman is in a car alone with a male driver, she may sit in the backseat behind the driver\u2019s seat out of his view.\n- Avoid wearing tight clothes that accentuate the shape of your body or legs. Most Saudis are accustomed to seeing Western clothing. However, it is advisable to ensure your legs, arms and shoulders are covered. Women are recommended to wear a\u00a0hair/head scarf covering\u00a0if visiting Saudi Arabia.\n- Pay respect to elderly in all situations. For example, standing up when they enter a room or offering them your seat.\n- It is polite to avoid blowing one\u2019s nose or spitting in public.\n- Casual whistling has suggestive connotations and may be seen as inappropriate depending on the context.\n- Loud aggression and/or drunkenness is looked upon very poorly.\n\nCountry: saudi_arabia.\nPlease justify: At a gathering, Sarah wanted to show her appreciation by passing a gift to her host, Tom.

        "instruction": "### Gift Giving\n- Gift giving (z\u014dt\u014d) is quite popular in Japan. Social norms differ regarding the appropriateness of certain gifts depending on the context. The general theme underpinning gift giving practices in Japan is that there is a reciprocal cycle of obligation and gratitude. Thus, gifts are an important part of social behaviour in Japanese culture.\n- Gifts are typically given to commemorate births, graduations, house visits, weddings and anniversaries. Traditionally, gifts were not given during Christmas or for birthdays, but this is becoming much more common in Japan.\n- There are also two popular gift giving seasons in Japan that coincide with major dates of significance. The first is\u00a0Ch\u016bgen,\u00a0which occurs around the Obon festival in July, and the second is\u00a0Seibo,\u00a0which occurs near the end of the year. Department stores in Japan often sell gifts specifically for\u00a0Ch\u016bgen\u00a0and\u00a0Seibo\u00a0that are already appropriately wrapped.\n- During\u00a0Ch\u016bgen,\u00a0people usually give gifts to their social superior. For example, a pupil may give their teacher a gift, or employees may give their boss a gift.\n- During\u00a0Seibo,\u00a0gifts are usually given as a way to express gratitude to those who are important or who have helped the individual in their life or business. It is often a way to recognise favours received throughout the year.\n- Proper etiquette is to give and receive a gift with both hands.\n- When giving a gift to an individual, it is usually done in private. Gifts given to a group are usually placed in a communal area so that everyone can share the gift.\n- People tend to wait until they are indoors to give a gift. Sometimes, flowers or plants are given outside.\n- Depending on the context, it is not uncommon for people to initially refuse the gift at first. The giver then insists the recipient takes the gift. However, refusing a gift from someone who is higher ranking is generally considered rude.\n- It is inappropriate for the giver to exaggerate or boast about the gift they are giving. Rather, people tend to de-emphasise the worth of a gift.\n- Popular gifts given in Japan include flowers, plants, edible gifts (e.g. food gift baskets, chocolate, fruits, savoury snacks), alcohol, stationery, small household items (e.g. hand towels) or clothing accessories (e.g. hats or scarves). People often appreciate gifts that are not from their current location.\n- The way a gift is presented is often considered as important as the gift itself. There are a number of customs and norms relating to how a gift should be wrapped depending on the situation. Generally, gifts are wrapped and presented nicely, no matter the gift. It is also acceptable to give gifts in a nice gift bag.\n- Monetary gifts are usually given in a decorative envelope. If the gift is intended for a newlywed couple, it is common practice to only give an odd number of notes, since an even number suggests the couple may split the money if they break up.\n- It is common to find small pre-wrapped gifts in many transit places in Japan, such as airports and train stations. These may be snacks, treats, bath products or souvenirs. Such gifts are known as \u2018omiyage\u2019\u00a0or \u2018temiyage\u2019\u00a0depending on the context. The general underlying idea is that the gift is produced from a city, town, region or country different from where the gift is given.\n- Omiyage\u00a0is often translated as \u2018souvenir\u2019 but generally refers to a local product to be given as a gift. These types of gifts are usually for travellers to bring back home to family, friends and coworkers to show thoughtfulness whilst away on travel.\n- Temiyage\u00a0refers to gifts given by visitors as a way to show appreciation. For example, when visiting someone\u2019s home in Japan, a foreign visitor will give a gift from their own country.\n- It is common for the receiver to thank the giver by writing them a letter or calling them on the phone. Depending on the occasion, it is also common for people to give a small gift in return (known as\u00a0okaeshi, a 'thank-you gift'). This type of gift is usually given after a funeral, illness, wedding or birth. The value of the gift is typically half of the value of the original gift.\n- There are several gifts that are inappropriate to give, unless the recipient specifically requests the item. It is usually inappropriate to give gifts relating to fire when visiting someone\u2019s home (such as an ashtray, heater or lighter). Sharp gifts such as scissors or knives are also inappropriate as they symbolise a wish to sever a relationship. Avoid giving lilies, lotus flowers, camellias or any white flower as these are usually associated with funerals.\n- Items that predominantly display the numbers four or nine are generally considered inappropriate (see Other Considerations). For example, it would be inappropriate to give someone four boxes of biscuits, or a comb that has nine teeth.\n\nCountry: japan.\nPlease justify: Alice visited her friend, Ben's house, and brought a nicely wrapped box of chocolates as a gift.

This custom is tied to Islamic principles that prescribe the left hand should be used for removal of dirt and for cleaning. It should not be used for functions such as waving, eating or offering items. Therefore, one should gesture, touch people, or offer items using both hands together.

It is customary for both hosts and guests to make toasts when visiting someone\u2019s house or sharing a meal. There are usually multiple speeches throughout the night dedicated to various topics, such as health, love, luck and all the best in life.\n- It is often expected that newcomers make a toast or speech of their own when meeting a new group of people, so be ready to deliver an eloquent greeting.\n- Generally, the first toast is to the reason you\u2019re meeting (e.g. a person\u2019s birthday, the friend who introduced you).\n- There may be specific traditions around the topics of subsequent toasts. For example, the third toast may be dedicated to love or to the women in the room.\n- A common toast is \u201cBudmo!\u201d (Let us be!).\n- Speeches are usually given in the order the host chooses or from the oldest to the youngest. The toasts tend to get longer as the night goes on.\n- It is important to be sincere during speeches. Ukrainians are earnest toast-makers and often place great importance on the speaker\u2019s words. People tend to be fatalistic, believing that good wishes are more likely to happen when spoken genuinely.\n- Drinking is a rite of passage in Ukrainian culture. It is traditional for Ukrainians to drink a strong liquor, such as vodka, brandy, whiskey or homemade \u2018samohon\u2019 (moonshine). However, today many people opt for beer or wine instead.\n- Vodka is drunk as a shot in 50 ml glasses (stopka).

For example, it is customary for a grieving household to receive visitors consistently for three days after a death.\n- There are many differences between Palestinian family homes.\u00a0Customs can also vary depending on the formality of the visit or your relationship with the person. Nevertheless, you can expect to be welcomed and received with hospitality.\n- It is best to arrange a time to meet to allow your host time to prepare for your visit, although relatives and close friends may visit one another regularly without giving notice.\n- Common expressions of welcome include \u201cAhlan wa sahlan\u201d (You are welcome here) and \u201cTafadal\u201d (\"Please\" meaning \u2018Come in\u2019, \u2018Sit down\u2019 or \u2018Help yourself\u2019 depending where the person is gesturing).\n- It is polite to bring a gift whenever invited to a Palestinian home. See\u00a0Gift Giving below for more information.\n- Expect to be offered a drink (e.g. tea, juice) and snacks (e.g. cake, nuts, fruit) as a gesture of hospitality during your visit.

However, be careful not to compliment a specific object or item too heavily, as it is customary for your host to offer it as a gift. If they try to give it to you, insist that you appreciate their gesture but do not want to take it. A Palestinian is likely to offer the object out of politeness and may end up giving you something they wished to keep if you accept.\n- While many Palestinians are not concerned with gender segregation, some religiously conservative families may require men and women to socialise in separate rooms.\n- Do not explore a person\u2019s house or enter rooms you have never been in before without being invited to. This includes looking for the bathroom. Always notify your host so that they can give other family members time to clear from the area if they\u2019d like to maintain their privacy.\n- Palestinians generally feel uncomfortable directly asking someone to leave their home. Therefore, try to read non-verbal cues in order not to overstay your welcome.\n- Towards the end of a visit, it is customary for the host to ask the guest to stay for coffee.

Jewish dietary laws make a distinction between kosher (appropriate) and terefah (forbidden). Some foods are inherently kosher for consumption (such as fish that have both fins and scales) or inherently terefah (such as pork). However, other foods require a prescribed method of preparation and slaughter. If this method is not followed, the food is classified as forbidden.\n- One main Jewish dietary law is the separation of meat and dairy in the same meal. As such, some of Israel\u2019s cuisine does not contain dishes with both meat and dairy mixed together.\n- Some Jewish Israeli households will have separate cooking utensils to ensure the separation of meat and dairy.\n- Some Jewish Israelis may also wait several hours after eating a meat dish before consuming dairy to avoid the mixing of meat and dairy in their stomach. The waiting time may be up to nine hours.\n- Muslim families and restaurants observe Islamic dietary rules, which categorise foods as either allowed (halal) or forbidden (haram). Generally, all food and drink is\u00a0halal except for specifically forbidden cases (such as meat that has not been prepared and slaughtered according to\u00a0halal\u00a0standards, and pork).\n- Foods that abide by Jewish dietary laws are considered halal for Muslims.\n\nCountry: israel.\nPlease justify: At a dinner party, Alice was about to prepare a dish for her guests.

        "instruction": "### Gift Giving\n- Gift giving (z\u014dt\u014d) is quite popular in Japan. Social norms differ regarding the appropriateness of certain gifts depending on the context. The general theme underpinning gift giving practices in Japan is that there is a reciprocal cycle of obligation and gratitude. Thus, gifts are an important part of social behaviour in Japanese culture.\n- Gifts are typically given to commemorate births, graduations, house visits, weddings and anniversaries. Traditionally, gifts were not given during Christmas or for birthdays, but this is becoming much more common in Japan.\n- There are also two popular gift giving seasons in Japan that coincide with major dates of significance. The first is\u00a0Ch\u016bgen,\u00a0which occurs around the Obon festival in July, and the second is\u00a0Seibo,\u00a0which occurs near the end of the year. Department stores in Japan often sell gifts specifically for\u00a0Ch\u016bgen\u00a0and\u00a0Seibo\u00a0that are already appropriately wrapped.\n- During\u00a0Ch\u016bgen,\u00a0people usually give gifts to their social superior. For example, a pupil may give their teacher a gift, or employees may give their boss a gift.\n- During\u00a0Seibo,\u00a0gifts are usually given as a way to express gratitude to those who are important or who have helped the individual in their life or business. It is often a way to recognise favours received throughout the year.\n- Proper etiquette is to give and receive a gift with both hands.\n- When giving a gift to an individual, it is usually done in private. Gifts given to a group are usually placed in a communal area so that everyone can share the gift.\n- People tend to wait until they are indoors to give a gift. Sometimes, flowers or plants are given outside.\n- Depending on the context, it is not uncommon for people to initially refuse the gift at first. The giver then insists the recipient takes the gift. However, refusing a gift from someone who is higher ranking is generally considered rude.\n- It is inappropriate for the giver to exaggerate or boast about the gift they are giving. Rather, people tend to de-emphasise the worth of a gift.\n- Popular gifts given in Japan include flowers, plants, edible gifts (e.g. food gift baskets, chocolate, fruits, savoury snacks), alcohol, stationery, small household items (e.g. hand towels) or clothing accessories (e.g. hats or scarves). People often appreciate gifts that are not from their current location.\n- The way a gift is presented is often considered as important as the gift itself. There are a number of customs and norms relating to how a gift should be wrapped depending on the situation. Generally, gifts are wrapped and presented nicely, no matter the gift. It is also acceptable to give gifts in a nice gift bag.\n- Monetary gifts are usually given in a decorative envelope. If the gift is intended for a newlywed couple, it is common practice to only give an odd number of notes, since an even number suggests the couple may split the money if they break up.\n- It is common to find small pre-wrapped gifts in many transit places in Japan, such as airports and train stations. These may be snacks, treats, bath products or souvenirs. Such gifts are known as \u2018omiyage\u2019\u00a0or \u2018temiyage\u2019\u00a0depending on the context. The general underlying idea is that the gift is produced from a city, town, region or country different from where the gift is given.\n- Omiyage\u00a0is often translated as \u2018souvenir\u2019 but generally refers to a local product to be given as a gift. These types of gifts are usually for travellers to bring back home to family, friends and coworkers to show thoughtfulness whilst away on travel.\n- Temiyage\u00a0refers to gifts given by visitors as a way to show appreciation. For example, when visiting someone\u2019s home in Japan, a foreign visitor will give a gift from their own country.\n- It is common for the receiver to thank the giver by writing them a letter or calling them on the phone. Depending on the occasion, it is also common for people to give a small gift in return (known as\u00a0okaeshi, a 'thank-you gift'). This type of gift is usually given after a funeral, illness, wedding or birth. The value of the gift is typically half of the value of the original gift.\n- There are several gifts that are inappropriate to give, unless the recipient specifically requests the item. It is usually inappropriate to give gifts relating to fire when visiting someone\u2019s home (such as an ashtray, heater or lighter). Sharp gifts such as scissors or knives are also inappropriate as they symbolise a wish to sever a relationship. Avoid giving lilies, lotus flowers, camellias or any white flower as these are usually associated with funerals.\n- Items that predominantly display the numbers four or nine are generally considered inappropriate (see Other Considerations). For example, it would be inappropriate to give someone four boxes of biscuits, or a comb that has nine teeth.\n\nCountry: japan.\nPlease justify: During a celebration at their office, Sarah decided to give her colleague, Michael, a thank-you gift for his help on a project.

New Zealanders consider most things to do with the nose to be poor etiquette (e.g. sniffing, wiping it with your hand, picking it with fingers or blowing it to clear snot onto the ground). It is particularly crude to pick at your nose in public.\n- Spitting in public places and/or in front of people is considered extremely rude.\n- It is common for New Zealanders to greet people with a brief \u2018Hello\u2019 when you walk past them. It is expected you respond with a greeting in return or a smile of acknowledgement.\n- Calling someone over by yelling \u201cOi\u201d can be interpreted as rude or even antagonising. However, younger generations may use this in an informal context with close peers.\n- Do not wave, yell or clap your hands to call over a waiter or service person. Instead, look out for them until they make eye contact, and then nod or raise your hand. You can also gently say \u201cexcuse me\u201d as they pass by.\n- While New Zealanders are quite informal, it is still good manners to say \u201cPlease\u201d when requesting something and \u201cThank you\u201d when someone does something for you. Giving a verbal \u2018Thank you\u2019 is politer than simply nodding your head or smiling.\n- Although you may hear New Zealanders swearing often, it is best to avoid swearing in public around strangers, in front of children or in professional settings.\n- Men are not expected to open doors for women. However, it is common politeness to hold a door open for someone if they are entering behind you, regardless of gender.\n- It is rude to try to skip a line if queuing for something. Wait your turn and never try to push in front of anyone. If you are in an urgent rush, you may politely explain your situation to the person in front of you or a managing employee to ask if they are comfortable with you moving ahead.\u00a0However, accept their answer if they decline.\n- New Zealanders expect punctuality when meeting up with someone.

As it is an honour to host, people are regularly invited to have tea with someone in their house or shop. The common Nepali saying demonstrates the generous approach to hosting: \u201cGuests are our god.\u201d\n- Many Nepalis like surprises and may drop in on each other unannounced. They may be led to think that Australians also like surprise visits. However, it is considered rude to invite yourself to join pre-made plans between other people. Wait to be invited to join others.\n- It is common for Nepalis to give invitations to people at the last moment. Therefore, if this happens, avoid interpreting this as meaning your invite was an afterthought. It likely happens to everyone.\n- If you are given an invitation to a specific occasion, it is polite to make time for a short appearance even if you\u2019re busy.\n- Expect to be offered tea and accept it as a gracious gesture, even if you do not drink it.\n- Check at the entrance of a person\u2019s home to see whether they have left shoes outside, indicating you should take yours off. It\u2019s polite to always offer to do so before entering the home.\n- As a guest, you will rarely be allowed to help your host prepare or clean up.\n- Nepalis usually socialise most before eating. When the meal is finished, people usually leave quickly afterward.\n- Some highlanders consider the hearth in a household sacred. Do not throw rubbish or scraps into it.\n- It is polite not to walk into someone else\u2019s kitchen until they have invited you to.\n\nCountry: nepal.\nPlease justify: Alice decided to visit her friend Tom without prior notice, bringing along a friend who Tom had never met before.

Most East Timorese view interpersonal relationships as more important than maintaining strict adherence to time.

        "instruction": "### Offering and Complimenting Items\n- There is a strong belief in the evil eye in Saudi Arabia whereby one\u2019s misfortune is caused by another\u2019s envy, sometimes taking the form of a curse. Complimenting or praising something too heavily can cause some Saudis to be wary that the evil eye will be jealous of it or curse it. People say \u201cMashallah\u201d (May God bless) to ward off the evil eye after a compliment and avoid hurting people\u2019s feelings. This phrase comforts people as it lets them know that you are giving an innocent compliment and do not wish harm. Expect to hear it highly frequently in conversation, and say it after every compliment.\n- In Saudi Arabia, people generally extend an offer multiple times. It is often polite to decline gestures initially and accept once the person has insisted. This exchange allows the offering person to show their sincerity in the gesture, and shows the receiver\u2019s humbleness.\n- Be sure to offer everything multiple times in return. If you only offer something once, a Saudi person may respond, \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay\u201d, out of modesty and politeness even though they meant to accept on the second offer.\n- Be careful when you compliment an item in a Saudi person\u2019s house, as they may feel compelled to offer it to you as a gift. If they try to give it to you, insist that you appreciate their gesture but do not want to take it. A Saudi person is likely to offer the object out of politeness, and if you accept, they may end up giving you something they wished to keep.\n- It is thought to be more sincere if compliments are given out of sight or earshot of the person who owns the possession or thing you are praising.\n- Show gratitude and humility when offered a compliment. This is done by responding with an equally respectful compliment on the same subject. If they are Muslim, you may wish them Allah\u2019s (God\u2019s) blessings.\n\nCountry: saudi_arabia.\nPlease justify: At a dinner party hosted by Samir, Emma noticed a beautiful painting on the wall and immediately praised it extensively.

This can lead to awkward situations in which a person can feel the offer is being forced upon them.\n- Refusing something offered can be interpreted as an insult.

Wash your hands thoroughly before eating.\n- Notify your host about any dietary requirements in advance (e.g. vegetarian). Palestinian hosts often go to great lengths to provide plenty of food for their guests and can be very disappointed if the person refuses to eat what they have prepared.\n- Most Palestinian families generally eat their main meal together, including during Ramadan. Men and women may eat separately in some circumstances (e.g. if the family is highly religious or the number of people eating is too large).\n- It is important to wait for everyone to be present before starting to eat, even if the meal is casual. Palestinians try not to eat separately out of respect for the family.\n- The father is usually served first out of respect, followed by the mother. However, guests are served first if present.\n- Palestinians generally eat with the right hand. It is impolite to pass food to one\u2019s mouth with the left.\n- Most families eat with utensils from separate plates. However, some traditional Palestinian food may be served on a common dish from which people serve themselves with their hands.\n- Practising Muslims do not eat anything containing alcohol or pork, in accordance with Islamic custom.\n- It is polite to accept multiple helpings (if offered) to show how much you enjoy the meal and your host\u2019s hospitality. Refusing food can be interpreted as rude. However, be aware that servings may be rationed in some low-income families.\n- According to Muslim practice, it is advisable to finish your plate. However, hosts may put extra food on a guest\u2019s plate out of respect or prompt their guests to have more servings than they can feasibly eat. It is acceptable to decline this or leave food on your plate if you simply cannot finish the meal.\n- Some people politely leave some food on their plate at the end of the meal to indicate to the host that they have provided adequately. Otherwise, if your plate is empty, your host may keep refilling it with more helpings of food.\n- As a host, try not to eat quickly and wait until everyone has eaten a fair amount before saying you\u2019re full. It is customary for everyone to stop eating and conclude the meal once the guest is full or finished.\n- After the meal has finished, a serving of tea, fruits, sweets or coffee is commonly offered. Coffee is often served at the conclusion of a meal.

Therefore, they generally do not require a profuse apology, a \u2018thank you\u2019 or even acknowledgement. Respect is exhibited in different ways.\n- Respect should always be shown to those that are older than you. This involves deferring to their opinion, waiting for their input and lowering your gaze if they are an elder.\n- Objects, gifts and food should be offered and received with two hands.\n- Remove your hat when indoors.\n- It is best practice to remove your shoes before entering a Korean home.\n- Koreans are reasonably punctual and usually prompt.

Commenting on someone\u2019s poor manners can be seen as overly formal.\n- Moderate swearing is common among friends and is not always considered rude.\n- Women are seen as capable individuals who can help themselves. Therefore, it is not considered wholly necessary for men to open car doors (etc.) for women. Doing so is recognised as very polite and courteous, but can also sometimes be seen as patronising depending on the circumstance.\n- When out to eat or for a drink, split bills equally by having people pay only for the food and drink they\u2019ve ordered. It is a common practice to buy \u2018rounds\u2019 of drinks while out with a group. If it is your round, you are expected to buy drinks for everyone you are with. Each individual who receives a drink will be expected to pay for at least one round.\n- Being reluctant to part with cash or share food or drink is seen as \u2018stingy\u2019 if other people have paid their share.

You can also gently say \u201cexcuse me\u201d as they pass by.\n- Tipping is not necessary in restaurants or places of service in Australia. People rarely leave tips or only do so if they received service that was exceedingly excellent.\n- Always say please when asking someone for help or a favour or you will come across as rude.\n- Punctuality is important in Australia, and people stick to the appointments, engagements and meetings they schedule.

You can say that you do not want any more food, but consider that they may take initial refusals as politeness and serve more anyway. You might have to clearly insist you are full.\n- It is best to take a small initial serving so you can accept more later and show how much you enjoy the meal.\n- It is best to eat everything on your plate to show that your host provided sufficiently and you enjoyed the food.\n- Cypriot food could be described as a fusion between Greek, Lebanese and Turkish cuisines. Often, there are many components to a meal, including vegetarian dishes (i.e. dolmades) and meat-based dishes (i.e. souvlaki). People help themselves to each dish to fill their own plate.\n- Let your Cypriot counterpart know if you have a dietary requirement so that they can help you eat appropriately. Some meals may appear to be vegetarian despite containing meat. For example, lamb kibbeh can be mistaken for a falafel.\n- Though the north is predominantly Muslim, it is still common to drink alcohol at special occasions.\n- Drink any alcohol served slowly at the same pace as everyone at the table. It is frowned upon to get drunk at a meal.\n- Do not rest your elbows on the table or put your hand under your chin as if you are bored.\n- It is rude to lean back in your seat and put your hands behind your head unless in a very casual situation. Around family, it would imply disrespect.\n- It is polite to offer to help the host or hostess in preparing and cleaning up after the meal. However, do not expect your gesture to be accepted unless you insist.\n\nCountry: cyprus.\nPlease justify: At a dinner party at her friend's house, Lisa immediately started eating her meal as soon as it was placed in front of her, without waiting for the host to indicate that it was time to begin.

Commenting on someone\u2019s poor manners can be seen as overly formal.\n- Moderate swearing is common among friends and is not always considered rude.\n- Women are seen as capable individuals who can help themselves. Therefore, it is not considered wholly necessary for men to open car doors (etc.) for women. Doing so is recognised as very polite and courteous, but can also sometimes be seen as patronising depending on the circumstance.\n- When out to eat or for a drink, split bills equally by having people pay only for the food and drink they\u2019ve ordered. It is a common practice to buy \u2018rounds\u2019 of drinks while out with a group. If it is your round, you are expected to buy drinks for everyone you are with. Each individual who receives a drink will be expected to pay for at least one round.\n- Being reluctant to part with cash or share food or drink is seen as \u2018stingy\u2019 if other people have paid their share. Furthermore, asking friends to pay for you on more than one occasion is seen as \u2018scabbing\u2019 and creates a bad reputation.\n- Being overdressed for a gathering is sometimes considered more embarrassing than being underdressed.\n- \n- It is considered impolite to ask a direct question about a person\u2019s salary or wealth. Inquiring about someone's weight or age is also highly\u00a0inappropriate in many situations.\n- Spitting in public is rude.\n- If there is a line for something, always queue and wait for your turn.\n- To call over a waiter or person of service, do not wave or yell. Instead, keep an eye out for them until they make eye contact, and then nod or raise your hand. You can also gently say \u201cexcuse me\u201d as they pass by.\n- Tipping is not necessary in restaurants or places of service in Australia. People rarely leave tips or only do so if they received service that was exceedingly excellent.\n- Always say please when asking someone for help or a favour or you will come across as rude.\n- Punctuality is important in Australia, and people stick to the appointments, engagements and meetings they schedule. If someone expects they will be more than 10 minutes late, they usually text or call the person to let them know in advance. That being said, punctuality has more importance in professional settings than in social ones.

In some cases, other guests may be expected to wait until the eldest male has begun eating before starting their meal.\n- It is impolite to use your cutlery to point or gesture during a meal.\n- You may be encouraged to accept second helpings to a meal.

It refers to the quality of being thoughtful and considerate of others in such a way that the host can anticipate the needs of their guests or customers and adjust accordingly. Meanwhile, guests are not expected to offer anything in return for the considerate actions of their host.\n- Two common phrases used to indicate politeness are \u201cGomen nasai\u201d (\u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019) and \u201cSumimasen\u201d (\u2018Excuse me\u2019). It is considered proper etiquette to state these phrases when you have made a mistake or caused inconvenience. Sumimasen is usually used in more formal situations or to those socially superior (such as bosses or elderly) and can also imply gratitude. Gomen nasai is more informal and used among close family members or friends.\n- It is common in Japan for people to wear face masks, generally as a way to protect against colds. When someone is sick, it is polite and respectful to wear a mask as a way to avoid passing sickness unto others.\n- People usually walk on the left side of a path, especially in busy areas. Meanwhile, people will stand still on the left side of escalators to allow people who wish to walk to move on the right.\n- Japanese businesses often leave a small tray near the cash register for the customer to place their money. This ensures that the cashier does not need to directly come into contact with the customer. Disregarding the money tray and holding money out for the cashier to take is considered highly impolite.\n- It is considered rude to count the received change in front of a cashier. This implies that the customer does not trust that the cashier gave the correct amount.\n- Punctuality is extremely valued in Japan. Being on time for meetings, appointments, services and parties is expected. This expectation is carried through to services, such as public transport arriving exactly at the expected time. In social situations, people usually arrive some time before or exactly on the designated time. If you expect a delay, politely inform your Japanese counterpart.\n\nCountry: japan.\nPlease justify: While purchasing a book at a local shop, Emily noticed a small tray near the cashier.

It can begin at 10pm on weekends, or even later.\n- People dine at restaurants (restaurantes or comedors)\u00a0for full meals or bars that serve \u2018tapas/pinchos\u2019\u00a0(small snacks) and \u2018raciones\u2019 (larger portions intended for sharing).

Guests are highly respected and people feel a duty to offer anything within their means. Even if a family has no food to provide a guest, they are expected to at least offer water.\n- Guests are always offered refreshments, typically tea. It is very important to accept any drink offered as a mark of friendship. Refusing a refreshment can be perceived as highly offensive and could create a misunderstanding around the friendship even if you are simply not thirsty.\n- Close friends, family and neighbours may visit one another frequently unannounced. A Somali may face some adjustment in having to arrange a time to meet.\n- Social visiting and hosting holds great importance in building and mending relations among friends and family members. Not visiting someone for a long period of time is considered a sign of the relationship\u2019s insignificance. People may also choose not to visit someone on purpose to indirectly reveal that they are angry/offended at something the person has done.\n- Be mindful that a Somali person\u2019s home is also their private place for prayer. Therefore, it is important to be clean and respectful.\n- Remove your shoes when entering someone\u2019s home unless advised otherwise.\n- Dogs are considered unclean in Somalia and are generally not allowed in areas where people pray (i.e. homes). Therefore, people rarely bring them inside their houses in Somalia and it\u2019s not common to have them as pets. Let your Somali counterpart know in advance if you have a pet dog. Do not ask them to sit in a place where your dog has just been resting. For example, it would be seen as rude for you to tell your dog to get off the couch and then offer someone to sit in its place.\n- Often an entire family will come to a household and visit at once. Men and women will usually converse separately whilst children play in an area that does not disturb adults.\n- Sometimes women will visit one another at home alone. If men want to socialise together, they often go to tea shops.\n- In Somalia, many households have two living rooms (one for each gender) where people socialise separately.\n- Visits can go on for hours. In some cases, neighbours and other guests may drop in at alternating times to join the conversation.\n- Expect goodbyes to be prolonged as people farewell everyone individually and the host walks you outside.

This is considered insulting. Similarly, it is inappropriate to cross your legs when facing someone.\n- When someone offers you something or makes a kind gesture towards you, it is polite to lightly protest first (e.g. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have\u201d, \u201cThat\u2019s lovely, but I couldn\u2019t\u201d). Once the person insists, you may accept the offer.\n- Some Iraqis observe a separation between the functions of the hands. This custom is tied to Islamic principles that prescribe the left hand should be used for removal of dirt and for cleaning. It should not be used for functions such as waving, eating or offering items. Therefore, one should gesture, touch people, or offer items using both hands together. Using the one hand alone can seem too informal, but if doing so, use the right.\n- Be aware that if you show admiration for an item or compliment a possession, an Iraqi may feel obliged to offer the item to you as a gift. Thus, it is best to avoid making too many comments on objects that are portable and expensive in people\u2019s homes.\n- In Iraq, people say \u2018Na\u2019eeman\u2019 (meaning \u2018be blessed\u2019) after someone has just had a shower or a haircut. This is compliment is very common - similar to saying \u2018bless you\u2019 when someone sneezes. As it is a expected form of politeness, neglecting to say it may be perceived as a slight or that you are ignoring the person.\n- It is common for Iraqis to be late. Punctuality is not highly important in Iraq and unpredictable incidents can disrupt daily schedules. Events and appointments also often run overtime as people usually try to give each other as much attention and respect as possible. Therefore, It can be a good idea to allow more time for an arrangement with an Iraqi than you normally would.\n- It is expected that men pay for the women in Iraq. One\u2019s honour is often judged by their generosity as well as their ability to provide for others in Iraq. Therefore, Iraqi men may insist on paying the bill for other men as well\u2014especially in a small group or business setting.

It is expected that you politely decline the gesture initially before accepting the second or third offer. This exchange is polite as the insistence to extend the invitation shows hospitality and the initial refusal to accept shows humbleness and that one is not greedy.\n- Consider that Ethiopians may refuse your offer initially out of politeness. Therefore, try and offer gestures more than once to give them the opportunity to accept something on the second or third attempt.\n- Strict punctuality is not expected in casual settings, but considerable lateness is also unacceptable.\n- It is considered inappropriate to ask to split a bill.

This may cause an Ethiopian to be wary that the evil eye will be jealous of it (see Traditional Beliefs in Religion).\n- If you have a young child that does not like to be touched by strangers, explain this to an Ethiopian.

People visit one another to celebrate events, catch up on community news and also to commiserate and support each other through hard times. For example, it is customary for a grieving household to receive visitors consistently for three days after a death.\n- There are many differences between Palestinian family homes.\u00a0Customs can also vary depending on the formality of the visit or your relationship with the person. Nevertheless, you can expect to be welcomed and received with hospitality.\n- It is best to arrange a time to meet to allow your host time to prepare for your visit, although relatives and close friends may visit one another regularly without giving notice.\n- Common expressions of welcome include \u201cAhlan wa sahlan\u201d (You are welcome here) and \u201cTafadal\u201d (\"Please\" meaning \u2018Come in\u2019, \u2018Sit down\u2019 or \u2018Help yourself\u2019 depending where the person is gesturing).\n- It is polite to bring a gift whenever invited to a Palestinian home. See\u00a0Gift Giving below for more information.\n- Expect to be offered a drink (e.g. tea, juice) and snacks (e.g. cake, nuts, fruit) as a gesture of hospitality during your visit. This is generally followed by coffee.\n- If a visit extends in length, a Palestinian host may also invite guests to join the upcoming household meal (see\u00a0Eating below).\n- It is courteous to make positive comments on your host\u2019s hospitality and home (e.g. the view from a window, the location of their home, cleanliness or the general d\u00e9cor). However, be careful not to compliment a specific object or item too heavily, as it is customary for your host to offer it as a gift. If they try to give it to you, insist that you appreciate their gesture but do not want to take it. A Palestinian is likely to offer the object out of politeness and may end up giving you something they wished to keep if you accept.\n- While many Palestinians are not concerned with gender segregation, some religiously conservative families may require men and women to socialise in separate rooms.\n- Do not explore a person\u2019s house or enter rooms you have never been in before without being invited to. This includes looking for the bathroom. Always notify your host so that they can give other family members time to clear from the area if they\u2019d like to maintain their privacy.\n- Palestinians generally feel uncomfortable directly asking someone to leave their home. Therefore, try to read non-verbal cues in order not to overstay your welcome.\n- Towards the end of a visit, it is customary for the host to ask the guest to stay for coffee. Palestinians refer to this as the \u2018goodbye coffee\u2019 as it is a polite way to signify the end of the visit. Guests should leave after drinking it.\n\nCountry: palestinian_territories.\nPlease justify: Alice was visiting her friend Sam's house for the first time.

Many meals are made up of multiple components that have varying degrees of chilli in them. Most Mexicans will be understanding and direct you on which salsas to avoid. Corn chips or tortillas are usually served with spicy dishes to relieve the sensation.\n- Lunch (comida) is the main meal of the day in Mexico. It is eaten in the afternoon. Dinner (cena) is smaller meal.

Mexicans often have a beer at the same time and sip one after the other intermittently.\n- People toast their drinks by yelling \u201cSalud!\u201d (Health).\n- If someone of the opposite gender invites you to dinner in Mexico, it is usually interpreted as a potentially romantic gesture.

When choosing a gift, keep in mind whether you are looking to offer it as a professional or personal gesture.\n- Pass gifts to the recipient with both hands.\n- Gifts are not opened immediately, but only once the giver has left. This is a way to save face for both the giver and receiver in case the person is disappointed with the gift.\n- Careful attention is paid to the wrapping of a gift, as the first impression it gives is very important. The more elaborate the wrapping, the better. Gifts wrapped in red and gold paper denote luck, whereas blue or black wrapping have sour connotations.\n- A Hong Kongese person may decline receiving a gift two or three times out of politeness before accepting, but be careful not to push against genuine refusals as the person may feel that they cannot repay the favour. Giving gifts that are impossible to reciprocate or match in a returned favour can cause the recipient to lose face.\n- Sweets, fruits, flowers (excluding red or white flowers) and alcoholic spirits make good gifts.\n- Do not give gifts that add up to 4 in number as 'four' pronounced in Cantonese sounds like the word for \u2018death\u2019.\n- Taboo items for gifts include\u00a0sharp objects (e.g. knives, scissors), clocks, handkerchiefs, umbrellas, green hats, mirrors and yellow or white flowers.

Generally, you can expect South Africans to be welcoming as long as you are making an attempt to understand the particular culture you are in.\n- While seated, do not point your feet towards others or the food.\n- White South Africans usually eat using a fork and knife (continental style). However, black and Indian South Africans often eat with spoons or fingers.\n- Some South African homes may follow a hierarchical sequence in the order of people served: guests first, followed by the eldest male, remaining men, children and, lastly, women. In some cases, other guests may be expected to wait until the eldest male has begun eating before starting their meal.\n- It is impolite to use your cutlery to point or gesture during a meal.\n- You may be encouraged to accept second helpings to a meal. Eating multiple helpings can be interpreted as a compliment to the host\u2019s hospitality and cooking in Indian South African homes.\n- Leaving uneaten food on your plate can be interpreted as a negative reflection on the food or host.\n- It is polite to make a small compliment towards the end of the meal on the hosts\u2019 cooking and/or hospitality.

However, some traditional Palestinian food may be served on a common dish from which people serve themselves with their hands.\n- Practising Muslims do not eat anything containing alcohol or pork, in accordance with Islamic custom.\n- It is polite to accept multiple helpings (if offered) to show how much you enjoy the meal and your host\u2019s hospitality.

Otherwise, if your plate is empty, your host may keep refilling it with more helpings of food.\n- As a host, try not to eat quickly and wait until everyone has eaten a fair amount before saying you\u2019re full.

It is considered extremely rude to show anger or disagreement towards an elderly person or interrupt them while they are speaking.\n- Western clothing is common and acceptable. However, there is a level of modesty expected in day-to-day clothing. For example, it is not appropriate to be barefoot in public.\u00a0It is advisable for women to dress modestly, ensuring their legs, arms and shoulders are covered.\n- Timekeeping is much looser than in English-speaking Western countries. For example, someone saying, \u201cI will be there soon\u201d does not necessarily mean that they are on their way. It is advisable to ask a person for a specific estimated time of arrival.\n- Many Palestinian men are raised to show chivalry, respect and honour to women by\u00a0opening doors, giving them their seat and carrying items for them.\n- If one offers an invitation to someone, it can often imply that their entire family is invited. It is good to clarify this beforehand.\n- People do not split bills in Palestinian culture. When people go out to dinner or an event, there is a general expectation that men pay for women. It is considered shameful for a woman to pay for a man.\n- If the bill is for two people of the same gender, generally the person who invited the other will pay. Otherwise, both individuals will usually compete with one another with one person conceding to let the other pay for them under the agreement that they will cover all costs during their next outing.\n- Some people may also expect those who are substantially wealthier to pay for others with more modest incomes. However, it is polite not to order expensive items or dishes when there is an understanding that you are not the person paying for them.\n- It is polite to use the right hand (or both hands together) to gesture, touch people or offer items. According to Islamic principles, the left hand should be used for hygiene purposes. Therefore, it is considered more unclean and should not be used for functions such as waving, eating or offering items.\n- Avoid eating, drinking or smoking in front of a Muslim during the fasting hours of Ramadan. In Muslim-majority countries, it is considered disrespectful (and often legally forbidden) to engage in these activities in public.\n- It is very rude to attempt to talk to or walk in front of someone who is praying.\n- Avoid having private conversations with unrelated members of the opposite gender, or being alone together in a confined space (e.g. a car).\n- Do not flirt or make comments about how good-looking someone from the opposite sex is.\n- Present yourself in a clean and tidy manner.

To be invited into someone\u2019s home is seen as a big honour.\n- An important distinction in Japanese homes is between the inside and outside. In many houses, there is a small space between the main door and the rest of the home that acts as an intermediate space. This entrance area is known as a \u2018genkan\u2019. The size of the\u00a0genkan\u00a0is usually proportionate to the size of the house; small houses will have a narrow\u00a0genkan\u00a0while larger houses will have a more spacious\u00a0genkan.\n- Traditionally, the main indoor space is slightly elevated and has separate flooring from the\u00a0genkan.\n- Importantly, the\u00a0genkan\u00a0is where people remove their shoes before entering the home. This is usually done as a way to avoid bringing dirt from outside into the house. It is extremely impolite to step foot past the\u00a0genkan\u00a0with outdoor shoes.\n- Outdoor shoes should be removed slowly, rather than kicked off the feet.\n- Once someone has removed their outdoor shoes, it is common practice to place the shoes on a provided shoe rack or to point the shoes towards the door.\n- Hosts will often provide guests with indoor slippers to wear while visiting the house.\n- Indoor slippers are usually worn all throughout the house except for spaces in some more traditional homes that have\u00a0tatami\u00a0mats (a type of flooring made of woven straw).\n- Some hosts may have separate slippers worn only when using the bathroom or toilet.\n- People nearly always bring a gift when visiting another person\u2019s home (see Gift Giving below for appropriate gifts).\n- Hosts usually indicate to guests where to sit when they enter a room.\n- The most important guest is offered the most honoured seat (kamiza), which is the seat furthest from the entrance.\n- The least important person present (usually the host) sits in the least honoured seat (shimoza), which is the seat closest to the entrance.\n- If the host does not indicate where to sit, the most appropriate choice is to sit closest to the entrance to demonstrate humility.\n- Some houses and restaurants in Japan follow the tradition of sitting around a low table. Sometimes, people will sit on the floor directly or on floor cushions. However, some places have a hole under the table where people can sit and hang their legs similar to if they were sitting on a chair.\n- When sitting on the floor, there are a couple of ways people are usually expected to sit.

This custom is called the \u2018kadaw\u2019. Many people may show respect to monks and images or depictions of Buddha in this same way.\n- It is considered important to dress in modest and neat clothing.

Most Burmese people wear a \u2018longyi\u2019\u00a0\u2013 a kind of long skirt.\n- When passing or receiving an item, use both hands together to signify respect. The right hand may be used alone in casual situations, but it is taboo to use one\u2019s left hand.\n- If a woman needs to pass something to a monk, it is best to give it to a male to then pass forward or hold the object with a handkerchief/tissue.

        "instruction": "### Visiting\n- Visiting people\u2019s houses is a central aspect of Palestinians\u2019 social life and an important social obligation. People visit one another to celebrate events, catch up on community news and also to commiserate and support each other through hard times. For example, it is customary for a grieving household to receive visitors consistently for three days after a death.\n- There are many differences between Palestinian family homes.\u00a0Customs can also vary depending on the formality of the visit or your relationship with the person. Nevertheless, you can expect to be welcomed and received with hospitality.\n- It is best to arrange a time to meet to allow your host time to prepare for your visit, although relatives and close friends may visit one another regularly without giving notice.\n- Common expressions of welcome include \u201cAhlan wa sahlan\u201d (You are welcome here) and \u201cTafadal\u201d (\"Please\" meaning \u2018Come in\u2019, \u2018Sit down\u2019 or \u2018Help yourself\u2019 depending where the person is gesturing).\n- It is polite to bring a gift whenever invited to a Palestinian home. See\u00a0Gift Giving below for more information.\n- Expect to be offered a drink (e.g. tea, juice) and snacks (e.g. cake, nuts, fruit) as a gesture of hospitality during your visit. This is generally followed by coffee.\n- If a visit extends in length, a Palestinian host may also invite guests to join the upcoming household meal (see\u00a0Eating below).\n- It is courteous to make positive comments on your host\u2019s hospitality and home (e.g. the view from a window, the location of their home, cleanliness or the general d\u00e9cor). However, be careful not to compliment a specific object or item too heavily, as it is customary for your host to offer it as a gift. If they try to give it to you, insist that you appreciate their gesture but do not want to take it. A Palestinian is likely to offer the object out of politeness and may end up giving you something they wished to keep if you accept.\n- While many Palestinians are not concerned with gender segregation, some religiously conservative families may require men and women to socialise in separate rooms.\n- Do not explore a person\u2019s house or enter rooms you have never been in before without being invited to. This includes looking for the bathroom. Always notify your host so that they can give other family members time to clear from the area if they\u2019d like to maintain their privacy.\n- Palestinians generally feel uncomfortable directly asking someone to leave their home. Therefore, try to read non-verbal cues in order not to overstay your welcome.\n- Towards the end of a visit, it is customary for the host to ask the guest to stay for coffee. Palestinians refer to this as the \u2018goodbye coffee\u2019 as it is a polite way to signify the end of the visit. Guests should leave after drinking it.\n\nCountry: palestinian_territories.\nPlease justify: During a visit to Sarah's house, Mike, feeling the need to use the restroom, started opening doors in search of it without asking Sarah.

It is rude to touch other people\u2019s heads.\n- If you accidentally do something (i.e. bump into someone or accidentally touch someone with your foot), it is good to apologise and pay back respect by touching the other person\u2019s shoulder or your own foot. Following this, touch your own forehead, giving a slight bow.\n- It is offensive to touch other people with your feet.

The general theme underpinning gift giving practices in Japan is that there is a reciprocal cycle of obligation and gratitude. Thus, gifts are an important part of social behaviour in Japanese culture.\n- Gifts are typically given to commemorate births, graduations, house visits, weddings and anniversaries. Traditionally, gifts were not given during Christmas or for birthdays, but this is becoming much more common in Japan.\n- There are also two popular gift giving seasons in Japan that coincide with major dates of significance. The first is\u00a0Ch\u016bgen,\u00a0which occurs around the Obon festival in July, and the second is\u00a0Seibo,\u00a0which occurs near the end of the year. Department stores in Japan often sell gifts specifically for\u00a0Ch\u016bgen\u00a0and\u00a0Seibo\u00a0that are already appropriately wrapped.\n- During\u00a0Ch\u016bgen,\u00a0people usually give gifts to their social superior. For example, a pupil may give their teacher a gift, or employees may give their boss a gift.\n- During\u00a0Seibo,\u00a0gifts are usually given as a way to express gratitude to those who are important or who have helped the individual in their life or business. It is often a way to recognise favours received throughout the year.\n- Proper etiquette is to give and receive a gift with both hands.\n- When giving a gift to an individual, it is usually done in private. Gifts given to a group are usually placed in a communal area so that everyone can share the gift.\n- People tend to wait until they are indoors to give a gift. Sometimes, flowers or plants are given outside.\n- Depending on the context, it is not uncommon for people to initially refuse the gift at first. The giver then insists the recipient takes the gift. However, refusing a gift from someone who is higher ranking is generally considered rude.\n- It is inappropriate for the giver to exaggerate or boast about the gift they are giving. Rather, people tend to de-emphasise the worth of a gift.\n- Popular gifts given in Japan include flowers, plants, edible gifts (e.g. food gift baskets, chocolate, fruits, savoury snacks), alcohol, stationery, small household items (e.g. hand towels) or clothing accessories (e.g. hats or scarves). People often appreciate gifts that are not from their current location.\n- The way a gift is presented is often considered as important as the gift itself. There are a number of customs and norms relating to how a gift should be wrapped depending on the situation. Generally, gifts are wrapped and presented nicely, no matter the gift. It is also acceptable to give gifts in a nice gift bag.\n- Monetary gifts are usually given in a decorative envelope. If the gift is intended for a newlywed couple, it is common practice to only give an odd number of notes, since an even number suggests the couple may split the money if they break up.\n- It is common to find small pre-wrapped gifts in many transit places in Japan, such as airports and train stations. These may be snacks, treats, bath products or souvenirs. Such gifts are known as \u2018omiyage\u2019\u00a0or \u2018temiyage\u2019\u00a0depending on the context. The general underlying idea is that the gift is produced from a city, town, region or country different from where the gift is given.\n- Omiyage\u00a0is often translated as \u2018souvenir\u2019 but generally refers to a local product to be given as a gift. These types of gifts are usually for travellers to bring back home to family, friends and coworkers to show thoughtfulness whilst away on travel.\n- Temiyage\u00a0refers to gifts given by visitors as a way to show appreciation. For example, when visiting someone\u2019s home in Japan, a foreign visitor will give a gift from their own country.\n- It is common for the receiver to thank the giver by writing them a letter or calling them on the phone. Depending on the occasion, it is also common for people to give a small gift in return (known as\u00a0okaeshi, a 'thank-you gift'). This type of gift is usually given after a funeral, illness, wedding or birth. The value of the gift is typically half of the value of the original gift.\n- There are several gifts that are inappropriate to give, unless the recipient specifically requests the item. It is usually inappropriate to give gifts relating to fire when visiting someone\u2019s home (such as an ashtray, heater or lighter). Sharp gifts such as scissors or knives are also inappropriate as they symbolise a wish to sever a relationship. Avoid giving lilies, lotus flowers, camellias or any white flower as these are usually associated with funerals.\n- Items that predominantly display the numbers four or nine are generally considered inappropriate (see Other Considerations). For example, it would be inappropriate to give someone four boxes of biscuits, or a comb that has nine teeth.\n\nCountry: japan.\nPlease justify: At a dinner party at her friend's house, Sarah wanted to show her appreciation by bringing a small gift.

For example, calling someone by a nickname or using an informal pronoun to talk to someone you are not close with is disrespectful.\n- Russians are generally punctual; however, they tend to see time as rather fluid.

For example, Russians may start entering a train or bus before those on board have had the time to exit. Commonly, one may be in line without actually standing there and will just inform the person in front of them they are behind them so that they can notify anyone else that arrives in the meantime. This \u2018reserves\u2019 their spot so they can do something else until it is their turn.\n- Dress neatly and tidily.

        "instruction": "### Gift Giving\n- Gift giving (z\u014dt\u014d) is quite popular in Japan. Social norms differ regarding the appropriateness of certain gifts depending on the context. The general theme underpinning gift giving practices in Japan is that there is a reciprocal cycle of obligation and gratitude. Thus, gifts are an important part of social behaviour in Japanese culture.\n- Gifts are typically given to commemorate births, graduations, house visits, weddings and anniversaries. Traditionally, gifts were not given during Christmas or for birthdays, but this is becoming much more common in Japan.\n- There are also two popular gift giving seasons in Japan that coincide with major dates of significance. The first is\u00a0Ch\u016bgen,\u00a0which occurs around the Obon festival in July, and the second is\u00a0Seibo,\u00a0which occurs near the end of the year. Department stores in Japan often sell gifts specifically for\u00a0Ch\u016bgen\u00a0and\u00a0Seibo\u00a0that are already appropriately wrapped.\n- During\u00a0Ch\u016bgen,\u00a0people usually give gifts to their social superior. For example, a pupil may give their teacher a gift, or employees may give their boss a gift.\n- During\u00a0Seibo,\u00a0gifts are usually given as a way to express gratitude to those who are important or who have helped the individual in their life or business. It is often a way to recognise favours received throughout the year.\n- Proper etiquette is to give and receive a gift with both hands.\n- When giving a gift to an individual, it is usually done in private. Gifts given to a group are usually placed in a communal area so that everyone can share the gift.\n- People tend to wait until they are indoors to give a gift. Sometimes, flowers or plants are given outside.\n- Depending on the context, it is not uncommon for people to initially refuse the gift at first. The giver then insists the recipient takes the gift. However, refusing a gift from someone who is higher ranking is generally considered rude.\n- It is inappropriate for the giver to exaggerate or boast about the gift they are giving. Rather, people tend to de-emphasise the worth of a gift.\n- Popular gifts given in Japan include flowers, plants, edible gifts (e.g. food gift baskets, chocolate, fruits, savoury snacks), alcohol, stationery, small household items (e.g. hand towels) or clothing accessories (e.g. hats or scarves). People often appreciate gifts that are not from their current location.\n- The way a gift is presented is often considered as important as the gift itself. There are a number of customs and norms relating to how a gift should be wrapped depending on the situation. Generally, gifts are wrapped and presented nicely, no matter the gift. It is also acceptable to give gifts in a nice gift bag.\n- Monetary gifts are usually given in a decorative envelope. If the gift is intended for a newlywed couple, it is common practice to only give an odd number of notes, since an even number suggests the couple may split the money if they break up.\n- It is common to find small pre-wrapped gifts in many transit places in Japan, such as airports and train stations. These may be snacks, treats, bath products or souvenirs. Such gifts are known as \u2018omiyage\u2019\u00a0or \u2018temiyage\u2019\u00a0depending on the context. The general underlying idea is that the gift is produced from a city, town, region or country different from where the gift is given.\n- Omiyage\u00a0is often translated as \u2018souvenir\u2019 but generally refers to a local product to be given as a gift. These types of gifts are usually for travellers to bring back home to family, friends and coworkers to show thoughtfulness whilst away on travel.\n- Temiyage\u00a0refers to gifts given by visitors as a way to show appreciation. For example, when visiting someone\u2019s home in Japan, a foreign visitor will give a gift from their own country.\n- It is common for the receiver to thank the giver by writing them a letter or calling them on the phone. Depending on the occasion, it is also common for people to give a small gift in return (known as\u00a0okaeshi, a 'thank-you gift'). This type of gift is usually given after a funeral, illness, wedding or birth. The value of the gift is typically half of the value of the original gift.\n- There are several gifts that are inappropriate to give, unless the recipient specifically requests the item. It is usually inappropriate to give gifts relating to fire when visiting someone\u2019s home (such as an ashtray, heater or lighter). Sharp gifts such as scissors or knives are also inappropriate as they symbolise a wish to sever a relationship. Avoid giving lilies, lotus flowers, camellias or any white flower as these are usually associated with funerals.\n- Items that predominantly display the numbers four or nine are generally considered inappropriate (see Other Considerations). For example, it would be inappropriate to give someone four boxes of biscuits, or a comb that has nine teeth.\n\nCountry: japan.\nPlease justify: During her visit to a friend's house, Sarah thoughtfully presented a beautifully wrapped gift bag to her friend, using both hands.

        "instruction": "### Basic Etiquette\n- In Turkey, people generally extend an offer multiple times. It is often polite to decline gestures initially and accept once the person has insisted. This exchange allows the offering person to show their sincerity in the gesture, and shows the receiver\u2019s humbleness.\n- Be sure to offer everything multiple times in return. If you only offer something once, a Turk may respond, \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay\u201d, out of modesty and politeness even though they meant to accept on the second offer.\n- You may have to be quite insistent if you truly want to refuse an offer or gesture. Place one hand on your chest as you say so. If someone has invited you somewhere, you can make the same gesture and point to your watch to indicate you do not have time to stay.\n- It is polite to stand when someone elderly enters the room. If they do not have a seat, it is expected that they will be offered someone else\u2019s.\n- It is customary for Turkish men to escort women to a seat and to the bathroom during a meal.\n- It is considered rude/disrespectful to chew gum whilst talking to someone of a higher status or at a formal occasion.\n- Avoid sitting in any position that allows one\u2019s shoe to face another person. This is considered insulting. Similarly, it is inappropriate to cross your legs when facing someone.\n- It is considered improper for a woman to cross her legs while sitting.\n- Ask permission before taking a woman\u2019s photograph.\n- Try to gesture, touch people or offer items using only the right hand or both hands together. Many Turks observe a separation between the functions of the hands. This custom is tied to Islamic principles that prescribe the left hand should only be used for removal of dirt and for cleaning. It may not necessarily be strictly followed, but it is best not to use the left hand unless the action is inevitable.\n- People rarely split a bill in Turkey. The person who invited the others to join them will commonly pay, whilst men are usually expected to pay for women.\u00a0You may offer to pay the whole bill; however, if your Turkish counterpart insists multiple times that you should leave it to them, allow them to pay.\u00a0It can be a kind gesture to offer to take them out in return next time.\n\nCountry: t\u00fcrkiye.\nPlease justify: During a dinner at a friend's house, Emily noticed that her friend's elderly grandmother had just entered the room.

        "instruction": "### Visiting\n- Afghans take great pride in their hospitality. It is considered an honour to host guests. Therefore, one may find that an Afghan seeks to host you quite early on in your friendship.\n- An invitation is not always needed in order to visit one\u2019s house in Afghanistan. Neighbours and friends may pay each other visits without planning them first.\n- Verbal invitations to visit someone\u2019s home may be open-ended. For instance, an Afghan may say that the person is welcome to visit without giving specifics on when that time should be. The guest is then expected to be opportunistic and visit soon. It is advisable to make it your responsibility to organise the place and time of a visit after an Afghan has expressed interest in a friendship to avoid cross-cultural miscommunications.\n- Remove your shoes at the door when visiting a home.\n- Wait to be led through the house and shown where to sit.\n- Men and women are separated in most social visits. Men socialise in one room, and women in another. The female hosts generally bring food and refreshments to the men before leaving and joining the women again.\n- You may be seated on the floor with rugs and cushions. Sit crossed-legged if you can or otherwise in a position that is comfortable for you. Avoid sitting with your legs outstretched or with the soles of your feet facing another person.\n- It is customary to be offered tea and sweets as refreshment. It is very important to accept any refreshment (typically coffee/tea) as a mark of friendship. Non-acceptance would be perceived as highly offensive and could create misunderstanding even if you are simply not thirsty. Your cup of tea will be constantly filled until you indicate you\u2019ve had enough by covering it with your hand and thanking them.\n- As a guest, expect to be offered the best of everything (the best cut of meat, best silverware, etc.). Even the poorest family will go to great lengths to make sure a guest feels welcomed and has the best treatment able to be given. Try to graciously accept everything offered. Refusing an Afghan\u2019s generosity can be awkward.\n- Dogs are considered unclean in Afghanistan and are not meant to be let into areas where people pray (i.e. homes). Therefore, people rarely bring them inside their houses and it\u2019s not common to have them as pets. Some Afghans may be uncomfortable around them or afraid of them. Let your Afghan counterpart know in advance if you have a pet dog and keep it in a separate room or outside whilst they are visiting. Do not ask them to sit in a place where your dog has just been resting. For example, it would be seen as rude for you to tell your dog to get off the couch and then offer someone to sit in its place.\n\nCountry: afghanistan.\nPlease justify: At a gathering, Sam offered Alice a cup of tea.

As a rule of thumb, gifts are typically symbolic or sentimental rather than lavish or expensive.\n- Flowers are generally not given as gifts, but rather are reserved for times of mourning or for other events such as weddings or religious festivities.\n- Avoid giving alcohol as a gift unless you are sure that the recipient drinks.\n- Black and white are colours reserved for funerals and mourning. Avoid wrapping gifts in these colours.\n- The religious affiliation of a person partially determines what gifts are considered inappropriate. For example, do not give a Muslim Sri Lankan gifts containing byproducts of alcohol or pork. Hindu Sri Lankans may take offence if given cow-related products, such as leather. In Sri Lanka, many Buddhists refrain from consuming beef.\n- Gifts are generally given and received with two hands.\n- To demonstrate graciousness, some Sri Lankans may touch their right forearm with their left hand while offering the gift with their right hand.\n- Gifts are typically not opened immediately upon receiving them.\n- It is expected that gift giving will be reciprocated.\n\nCountry: sri_lanka.\nPlease justify: At a friend's house, Charlie decided to give a birthday present.

The entire vicinity of the village is their private place. Therefore, be respectful at all times.\n- Announce your visit to signify you are a stranger (either before you enter or as you walk in). This gives the villagers time to cover up or go to a private place if they do not wish to be seen. You may see some people shut the doors to their house: it is similar to entering a friend\u2019s home and seeing some of the bedroom doors shut out of privacy.\n- In villages, dress respectfully and modestly. Women should cover their shoulders and all dresses or pants should cover the knees. Do not wear hats, sunglasses, shoulder bags or scanty dresses. Wearing a hat is an insult to the chief.\n- Ask to see the village headman (turanga ni koro) when you arrive so you can give him an introductory gift (sevusevu). Kava is the most customary form of sevusevu. Other appropriate gifts may be books, school supplies, children\u2019s toys or food.\n- Remove your shoes before entering a Fijian household.\n- Wait to be shown in and seat yourself by the door.\n- It is best to sit cross-legged looking down out of respect.\n- If you are joining company, shake hands with everyone who is already present and introduce yourself.\n- There may be a welcome ceremony to the village. This involves drinking kava with the chief. This is a mild narcotic drink made from ground-up roots. Drinking it has a calming, docile effect on people and usually loosens everyone up.

When a person is about to have a meal, they usually announce it to let others gather so they can all say a blessing and eat together.\n- Table service can take a long time at Fijian restaurants. Be patient and refrain from shouting to summon people\u2019s attention.

Therefore, they generally do not require a profuse apology, a \u2018thank you\u2019 or even acknowledgement.

Therefore, one may find that an Afghan seeks to host you quite early on in your friendship.\n- An invitation is not always needed in order to visit one\u2019s house in Afghanistan. Neighbours and friends may pay each other visits without planning them first.\n- Verbal invitations to visit someone\u2019s home may be open-ended. For instance, an Afghan may say that the person is welcome to visit without giving specifics on when that time should be. The guest is then expected to be opportunistic and visit soon. It is advisable to make it your responsibility to organise the place and time of a visit after an Afghan has expressed interest in a friendship to avoid cross-cultural miscommunications.\n- Remove your shoes at the door when visiting a home.\n- Wait to be led through the house and shown where to sit.\n- Men and women are separated in most social visits. Men socialise in one room, and women in another. The female hosts generally bring food and refreshments to the men before leaving and joining the women again.\n- You may be seated on the floor with rugs and cushions. Sit crossed-legged if you can or otherwise in a position that is comfortable for you. Avoid sitting with your legs outstretched or with the soles of your feet facing another person.\n- It is customary to be offered tea and sweets as refreshment. It is very important to accept any refreshment (typically coffee/tea) as a mark of friendship. Non-acceptance would be perceived as highly offensive and could create misunderstanding even if you are simply not thirsty. Your cup of tea will be constantly filled until you indicate you\u2019ve had enough by covering it with your hand and thanking them.\n- As a guest, expect to be offered the best of everything (the best cut of meat, best silverware, etc.). Even the poorest family will go to great lengths to make sure a guest feels welcomed and has the best treatment able to be given. Try to graciously accept everything offered. Refusing an Afghan\u2019s generosity can be awkward.\n- Dogs are considered unclean in Afghanistan and are not meant to be let into areas where people pray (i.e. homes). Therefore, people rarely bring them inside their houses and it\u2019s not common to have them as pets. Some Afghans may be uncomfortable around them or afraid of them. Let your Afghan counterpart know in advance if you have a pet dog and keep it in a separate room or outside whilst they are visiting. Do not ask them to sit in a place where your dog has just been resting. For example, it would be seen as rude for you to tell your dog to get off the couch and then offer someone to sit in its place.\n\nCountry: afghanistan.\nPlease justify: During a visit to Alex's house, Jamie noticed that Alex's dog was freely roaming around the living room where they were seated.

It is expected that koha should only be what people can afford. However, as a general guideline $20 NZD per person is a standard koha when visiting a marae for personal reasons. For business or government service related visits, additional koha of a larger sum should be provided by your organisation.\n- Visitors should give their koha to one person who presents it on behalf of the group.

It is expected that you politely decline the gesture initially before accepting on the third offer. This exchange is polite as the insistence to extend the invitation shows hospitality and the initial refusal to accept shows humbleness and that one is not greedy.\n- Be sure to offer everything multiple times in return. If you only offer something once, an Afghan person may respond, \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay\u201d, out of modesty and politeness even though they meant to accept on the second offer.\n- Be careful when you compliment an item in an Afghan\u2019s house, as they may feel compelled to offer it to you as a gift. If they try to give it to you, insist that you appreciate their gesture but do not want to take it. An Afghan is likely to offer the object out of politeness, and if you accept, they may end up giving you something they wished to keep.\n- There is a strong belief in the evil eye in Afghanistan whereby one\u2019s misfortune is caused by another\u2019s envy, sometimes taking the form of a curse. Do not compliment something more than once or continue to praise it once you have acknowledged it. This may cause an Afghan to be wary that the evil eye will be jealous of it.\n- People say \u201cMashallah\u201d (May God bless) to ward off the evil eye after a compliment to show you don\u2019t have bad intentions.\n- Show gratitude and humility when offered a compliment.

Once they have begun, everyone is invited to begin their meal.\n- Chopsticks are the most common utensils used when eating, sometimes accompanied with a soup spoon.\n- For disposable chopsticks, it is considered rude to rub them together. This may imply to the restaurant owner that the customer views the restaurant as cheap.\n- When chopsticks are not being used, they are usually laid down in front of the person with the tips to the left.\n- It is highly inappropriate to stick chopsticks into food, especially into a bowl of rice.

The exception to this is slurping, which is socially acceptable for certain foods, especially noodle dishes such as\u00a0ramen.\n- Leaving a plate completely empty after a meal signifies to the host that you are satisfied and do not wish to be served more food.\n- It is not considered impolite to leave food on the plate when being served by others. However, when serving oneself, it is rude to over-serve and not complete the meal.\n- Once a meal is complete, a common phrase stated is\u00a0\u201cGochisousama-deshita\u201d, which is generally understood as a statement of gratitude for the effort and the expense of the meal.\n- People generally avoid eating or drinking while walking in public settings. If someone purchases a takeaway drink (especially from a vending machine), they usually drink the beverage near the machine and recycle the packaging in the nearby bin.\n- The most common alcoholic beverage in Japan is\u00a0sake,\u00a0a brewed alcohol made from fermented rice.

Therefore, one may find that an Afghan seeks to host you quite early on in your friendship.\n- An invitation is not always needed in order to visit one\u2019s house in Afghanistan. Neighbours and friends may pay each other visits without planning them first.\n- Verbal invitations to visit someone\u2019s home may be open-ended. For instance, an Afghan may say that the person is welcome to visit without giving specifics on when that time should be. The guest is then expected to be opportunistic and visit soon. It is advisable to make it your responsibility to organise the place and time of a visit after an Afghan has expressed interest in a friendship to avoid cross-cultural miscommunications.\n- Remove your shoes at the door when visiting a home.\n- Wait to be led through the house and shown where to sit.\n- Men and women are separated in most social visits. Men socialise in one room, and women in another. The female hosts generally bring food and refreshments to the men before leaving and joining the women again.\n- You may be seated on the floor with rugs and cushions. Sit crossed-legged if you can or otherwise in a position that is comfortable for you. Avoid sitting with your legs outstretched or with the soles of your feet facing another person.\n- It is customary to be offered tea and sweets as refreshment. It is very important to accept any refreshment (typically coffee/tea) as a mark of friendship. Non-acceptance would be perceived as highly offensive and could create misunderstanding even if you are simply not thirsty. Your cup of tea will be constantly filled until you indicate you\u2019ve had enough by covering it with your hand and thanking them.\n- As a guest, expect to be offered the best of everything (the best cut of meat, best silverware, etc.). Even the poorest family will go to great lengths to make sure a guest feels welcomed and has the best treatment able to be given. Try to graciously accept everything offered. Refusing an Afghan\u2019s generosity can be awkward.\n- Dogs are considered unclean in Afghanistan and are not meant to be let into areas where people pray (i.e. homes). Therefore, people rarely bring them inside their houses and it\u2019s not common to have them as pets. Some Afghans may be uncomfortable around them or afraid of them. Let your Afghan counterpart know in advance if you have a pet dog and keep it in a separate room or outside whilst they are visiting.

The statement expresses gratitude for those who contributed to providing and preparing the meal.\n- It is impolite to begin eating before everyone has gathered at the table, ready to partake in the meal.\n- The most honoured guest or highest-ranked person eats first. Once they have begun, everyone is invited to begin their meal.\n- Chopsticks are the most common utensils used when eating, sometimes accompanied with a soup spoon.\n- For disposable chopsticks, it is considered rude to rub them together. This may imply to the restaurant owner that the customer views the restaurant as cheap.\n- When chopsticks are not being used, they are usually laid down in front of the person with the tips to the left.\n- It is highly inappropriate to stick chopsticks into food, especially into a bowl of rice. This practice of placing chopsticks upright in a bowl of rice is a funerary practice known as \u2018tsukitate-bashi\u2019.\n- Food is never passed directly from one person\u2019s chopsticks to another.\n- Pointing or waving at people or objects with chopsticks is considered to be impolite.\n- Chewing with one\u2019s mouth open is considered impolite.\n- When eating soup or rice, it is acceptable to lift the bowl closer to your mouth to avoid spilling food. Generally,\u00a0miso\u00a0soup (which accompanies many meals) is drunk directly from the bowl, while larger soups are usually consumed by using a soup spoon.\n- White rice is a common staple component of most Japanese meals. The rice often comes with accompaniments.\n- It is considered impolite for someone to blow their nose at the table, as well as make other loud noises such as burping or munching. The exception to this is slurping, which is socially acceptable for certain foods, especially noodle dishes such as\u00a0ramen.\n- Leaving a plate completely empty after a meal signifies to the host that you are satisfied and do not wish to be served more food.\n- It is not considered impolite to leave food on the plate when being served by others. However, when serving oneself, it is rude to over-serve and not complete the meal.\n- Once a meal is complete, a common phrase stated is\u00a0\u201cGochisousama-deshita\u201d, which is generally understood as a statement of gratitude for the effort and the expense of the meal.\n- People generally avoid eating or drinking while walking in public settings.

Cutting in line may be tolerated if the person who comes later believes they are more important than others in line, or they know someone who can assist with jumping the line. For example, \u2018doutor fulano\u2019 (\u2018doctor so-and-so\u2019) may cut in front because the person serving is a patient of theirs. These intricate dynamics determine not only who is next in line, but also who generally excels in society.\n- Given large family sizes and typically small living quarters, Brazilians are generally not demanding regarding their privacy. Within one family, possessions are typically thought to be communal and \u00a0are shared amongst everyone. Thus, it is expected to be open about one\u2019s possessions and space.\n\nCountry: brazil.\nPlease justify: At a local community center, Emily saw her friend Sarah waiting in a long line.

When choosing a gift, keep in mind whether you are looking to offer it as a professional or personal gesture.\n- Pass gifts to the recipient with both hands.\n- Gifts are not opened immediately, but only once the giver has left. This is a way to save face for both the giver and receiver in case the person is disappointed with the gift.\n- Careful attention is paid to the wrapping of a gift, as the first impression it gives is very important. The more elaborate the wrapping, the better. Gifts wrapped in red and gold paper denote luck, whereas blue or black wrapping have sour connotations.\n- A Hong Kongese person may decline receiving a gift two or three times out of politeness before accepting, but be careful not to push against genuine refusals as the person may feel that they cannot repay the favour. Giving gifts that are impossible to reciprocate or match in a returned favour can cause the recipient to lose face.\n- Sweets, fruits, flowers (excluding red or white flowers) and alcoholic spirits make good gifts.\n- Do not give gifts that add up to 4 in number as 'four' pronounced in Cantonese sounds like the word for \u2018death\u2019.\n- Taboo items for gifts include\u00a0sharp objects (e.g. knives, scissors), clocks, handkerchiefs, umbrellas, green hats, mirrors and yellow or white flowers.

It is good manners to accept this as it shows esteem in their friendship as well as their hospitality.\n- When at a dinner, try to taste all the dishes offered as a sign of respect and gratefulness.\n- It is common for the host or hostess to urge their guests to have multiple servings. Having second servings shows that you are enjoying their hospitality. Therefore, serve yourself less on the first helping so you don\u2019t fill up and are able to show the good gesture of accepting multiple.\n- The Lebanese are exceptionally hospitable, sometimes being so generous that they actually embarrass their Australian guests or make them feel awkward. For example, there is often an expectation that the guest will accept what is offered. If you refuse something, it may be seen as a token protest made out of politeness, and thus, a Lebanese person may insist that you receive what is given instead of accepting your refusal. This can lead to awkward situations in which an Australian can feel the offer is being forced upon them. The closer you are to a person, the more acceptable it is to decline their offers of tea, coffee, food, etc.\n- The Lebanese socialise around meals for long periods of time.

This custom is tied to Islamic principles that prescribe the left hand should be used for removal of dirt and for cleaning. It should not be used for functions such as waving, eating or passing items. Therefore, one should gesture, touch people or offer items using both hands together. Using the one hand alone can seem too informal, but if doing so, use the right.\n- Tipping is common in Saudi Arabia, but it is not routine. It is also not required if a service charge is already included in the bill. Saudis usually tip expatriate service people and individual services in hotels despite the overall service charge. For example, it is appropriate to leave $1-2USD for a porter or housekeeper.\n- Punctuality depends on the priority of the occasion. Saudi Arabians generally have a more relaxed approach to time-keeping in casual settings. People do not adhere to tight schedules and are quite tolerant of lateness when meeting with friends. However, punctuality is expected and adhered to in professional settings (see Business Culture).\n- It is considered rude to check the time whilst in conversation with someone or at a social gathering. Time spent with friends is considered time well spent.\n- Ask permission before taking anyone\u2019s photo or posting it online, especially if they are a woman.\n- Avoid sitting in any position that allows one\u2019s shoe to face another person. This is considered insulting. Similarly, it is inappropriate to cross your legs when facing someone.\n- Try to avoid situations in which you will be left alone with a member of the opposite gender (e.g. elevators, cars). If a woman is in a car alone with a male driver, she may sit in the backseat behind the driver\u2019s seat out of his view.\n- Avoid wearing tight clothes that accentuate the shape of your body or legs. Most Saudis are accustomed to seeing Western clothing. However, it is advisable to ensure your legs, arms and shoulders are covered.

There are usually multiple speeches throughout the night dedicated to various topics, such as health, love, luck and all the best in life.\n- It is often expected that newcomers make a toast or speech of their own when meeting a new group of people, so be ready to deliver an eloquent greeting.\n- Generally, the first toast is to the reason you\u2019re meeting (e.g. a person\u2019s birthday, the friend who introduced you).\n- There may be specific traditions around the topics of subsequent toasts. For example, the third toast may be dedicated to love or to the women in the room.\n- A common toast is \u201cBudmo!\u201d (Let us be!).\n- Speeches are usually given in the order the host chooses or from the oldest to the youngest. The toasts tend to get longer as the night goes on.\n- It is important to be sincere during speeches. Ukrainians are earnest toast-makers and often place great importance on the speaker\u2019s words. People tend to be fatalistic, believing that good wishes are more likely to happen when spoken genuinely.\n- Drinking is a rite of passage in Ukrainian culture. It is traditional for Ukrainians to drink a strong liquor, such as vodka, brandy, whiskey or homemade \u2018samohon\u2019 (moonshine). However, today many people opt for beer or wine instead.\n- Vodka is drunk as a shot in 50 ml glasses (stopka). This is followed by eating a small portion of food (zakuska), usually a piece of bread and sausage, salad or pickles.\n- If you don\u2019t drink after a toast, you may be regarded with suspicion as a person who can\u2019t be trusted.\n- It is acceptable to try to refuse servings of alcohol after the first toast. However, be aware your host will likely refill your glass anyway.\n- It is often easiest to refuse alcohol on the basis of health reasons if you cannot or do not want to drink.\n- The last toast of the evening is always \u201cNa Konya!\u201d (literally translated as \u201con the horse\u201d). It is the Ukrainian equivalent of \u201cLet\u2019s have one for the road\u201d and is the indication that guests are going to leave.\n\nCountry: ukraine.\nPlease justify: At a dinner hosted at her friend's house, Chloe was offered the opportunity to make a toast.

If someone turns up late and apologises, people are likely to respond with something like \u201cno pasa nada\u201d \u2013 meaning \u201cIt\u2019s not that important\u201d.\n- Tipping is not routinely expected in Spain and Spaniards generally never tip at restaurants with table service.\n- In Spain, the most common way to pay for something is \u2018pagar a pachas\u2019 (paid by half), which means dividing the bill equally so each individual pays for their portion fairly. This is most common among younger people.\n- If a person invites others out for a particularly special or expensive occasion, there may be an expectation that the host pays for the guests.\n- It is best not to protest someone paying for you, even out of politeness as arguing over the bill is seen as bad manners. The best thing to do is give them some money later on once you have left the restaurant, or pay for a drink or dessert. If you want to insist on paying the bill to make a good gesture, you can get up as if going to the restroom and ask the waiter privately for the bill, paying for it there.\n\nCountry: spain.\nPlease justify: At the end of a friendly dinner, Sarah quietly approached the waiter and paid for everyone's meal.

However, there is a level of modesty expected in day-to-day clothing.

For example, someone saying, \u201cI will be there soon\u201d does not necessarily mean that they are on their way. It is advisable to ask a person for a specific estimated time of arrival.\n- Many Palestinian men are raised to show chivalry, respect and honour to women by\u00a0opening doors, giving them their seat and carrying items for them.\n- If one offers an invitation to someone, it can often imply that their entire family is invited. It is good to clarify this beforehand.\n- People do not split bills in Palestinian culture. When people go out to dinner or an event, there is a general expectation that men pay for women. It is considered shameful for a woman to pay for a man.\n- If the bill is for two people of the same gender, generally the person who invited the other will pay. Otherwise, both individuals will usually compete with one another with one person conceding to let the other pay for them under the agreement that they will cover all costs during their next outing.\n- Some people may also expect those who are substantially wealthier to pay for others with more modest incomes.

Even if a family has no food to provide a guest, they are expected to at least offer water.\n- It is very important to accept any refreshment (typically coffee/tea) as a mark of friendship. Non-acceptance would be perceived as highly offensive and could create misunderstanding even if you are simply not thirsty.\n- Social visiting and hosting has a great importance for building and mending relations among friends and family members. Not visiting someone for a long period of time is considered a sign of the relationship\u2019s insignificance. People may also choose not to visit someone on purpose to indirectly reveal that they are angry/offended at something the person has done.\n- If you are unable to visit a friend for a long period of time, make contact by phone to keep the relationship alive and make it known that you are not ignoring them.\n- Close friends, family and neighbours may visit one another frequently unannounced, especially in rural areas. However, busy schedules mean that most visits among broader friends are planned in advance.\n- Friday is the most popular day for visits, as it is a holy day of rest in Sudan.\n- Guests usually arrive at mid-morning or early evening to avoid interrupting a family meal. If you do happen to arrive during meal time, you will be asked to join them at the table. In this case, only accept a small amount of food.\n- Make sure your house is clean before inviting a Sudanese person over. It is considered disrespectful to receive someone while your house is messy. They may feel that you do not care about their opinion of you.\n- Be mindful that a Sudanese person\u2019s home is also their private place for prayer. Therefore, it is important to be clean and respectful.\n- Remove your shoes when entering someone\u2019s home unless advised otherwise.\n- Dogs are considered unclean in Sudan and are not meant to be let into areas where people pray (i.e. homes). Therefore, people rarely bring them inside their houses in Sudan and it\u2019s not common to have them as pets. Let your Sudanese counterpart know in advance if you have a pet dog. Do not ask them to sit in a place where your dog has just been resting. For example, it would be seen as rude for you to tell your dog to get off the couch and then offer someone to sit in its place.\n- Often an entire family will come to a household and visit at once. Men and women will usually converse separately whilst children play in an area that does not disturb adults.\n- In Sudan, many households have two living rooms (one for each gender) where people socialise separately.\n- The Sudanese do not sit on the floor as is customary in some neighbouring cultures.

For example, it would be considered rude to comment on or point out someone\u2019s mistakes or behaviour in the presence of others.\n- It is considered inappropriate to ask direct questions about someone\u2019s political affiliations, religion, salary, wealth, weight or age.\n- New Zealanders tend to speak about religion and politics in general terms without indicating their personal beliefs or convictions, unless asked directly.\n- Use tissues or handkerchiefs if you need to clear your nose. New Zealanders consider most things to do with the nose to be poor etiquette (e.g. sniffing, wiping it with your hand, picking it with fingers or blowing it to clear snot onto the ground). It is particularly crude to pick at your nose in public.\n- Spitting in public places and/or in front of people is considered extremely rude.\n- It is common for New Zealanders to greet people with a brief \u2018Hello\u2019 when you walk past them. It is expected you respond with a greeting in return or a smile of acknowledgement.\n- Calling someone over by yelling \u201cOi\u201d can be interpreted as rude or even antagonising. However, younger generations may use this in an informal context with close peers.\n- Do not wave, yell or clap your hands to call over a waiter or service person. Instead, look out for them until they make eye contact, and then nod or raise your hand. You can also gently say \u201cexcuse me\u201d as they pass by.\n- While New Zealanders are quite informal, it is still good manners to say \u201cPlease\u201d when requesting something and \u201cThank you\u201d when someone does something for you. Giving a verbal \u2018Thank you\u2019 is politer than simply nodding your head or smiling.\n- Although you may hear New Zealanders swearing often, it is best to avoid swearing in public around strangers, in front of children or in professional settings.\n- Men are not expected to open doors for women. However, it is common politeness to hold a door open for someone if they are entering behind you, regardless of gender.\n- It is rude to try to skip a line if queuing for something. Wait your turn and never try to push in front of anyone. If you are in an urgent rush, you may politely explain your situation to the person in front of you or a managing employee to ask if they are comfortable with you moving ahead.\u00a0However, accept their answer if they decline.\n- New Zealanders expect punctuality when meeting up with someone. Being more than 5\u201310 minutes late without giving someone forewarning is considered disrespectful.\n- Clean up after yourself at all times and do not litter (especially in national parks). Casual disrespect for the natural environment is frowned upon.\n\nCountry: new_zealand.\nPlease justify: At a dinner party, Sarah noticed her colleague, Tom, making a mistake in a business calculation he shared with the group.

If giving flowers, the number of flowers in the bouquet should count to an odd number (e.g. 5, 7, 9).

Christmas is usually celebrated with a meal and time spent with family rather than gift giving.\n- It is customary to open wrapped gifts right away in front of the giver.\n- Close friends and family may give each other money as gifts. Cash gifts may also be given at weddings.\n- It is common practice for co-workers to contribute money towards buying a gift for someone on their birthday or another special event.\n- People often bring homemade food and alcoholic drinks into their workplaces to celebrate special occasions (e.g. a birthday or engagement), usually after work.\n\nCountry: ukraine.\nPlease justify: Jack visited his friend Lisa's house for the first time and decided to bring a bouquet as a token of appreciation.

People use their right hand, scooping with the fingers.\n- Use the right hand to serve and pass any food or dish, in accordance with Islamic custom. The left hand is considered unclean and shouldn\u2019t make direct contact with food.\n- When eating rice, it is normal to form the rice into a small ball before placing it in the mouth.

If you refuse something, it may be seen as a token protest made out of politeness, and thus, a Lebanese person may insist that you receive what is given instead of accepting your refusal.

People feel a duty to offer anything else within their means. Even if a family has no food to provide a guest, they are expected to at least offer water.\n- It is very important to accept any refreshment (typically coffee/tea) as a mark of friendship. Non-acceptance would be perceived as highly offensive and could create misunderstanding even if you are simply not thirsty.\n- Social visiting and hosting has a great importance for building and mending relations among friends and family members. Not visiting someone for a long period of time is considered a sign of the relationship\u2019s insignificance. People may also choose not to visit someone on purpose to indirectly reveal that they are angry/offended at something the person has done.\n- If you are unable to visit a friend for a long period of time, make contact by phone to keep the relationship alive and make it known that you are not ignoring them.\n- Close friends, family and neighbours may visit one another frequently unannounced, especially in rural areas. However, busy schedules mean that most visits among broader friends are planned in advance.\n- Friday is the most popular day for visits, as it is a holy day of rest in Sudan.\n- Guests usually arrive at mid-morning or early evening to avoid interrupting a family meal. If you do happen to arrive during meal time, you will be asked to join them at the table. In this case, only accept a small amount of food.\n- Make sure your house is clean before inviting a Sudanese person over. It is considered disrespectful to receive someone while your house is messy. They may feel that you do not care about their opinion of you.\n- Be mindful that a Sudanese person\u2019s home is also their private place for prayer. Therefore, it is important to be clean and respectful.\n- Remove your shoes when entering someone\u2019s home unless advised otherwise.\n- Dogs are considered unclean in Sudan and are not meant to be let into areas where people pray (i.e. homes). Therefore, people rarely bring them inside their houses in Sudan and it\u2019s not common to have them as pets. Let your Sudanese counterpart know in advance if you have a pet dog. Do not ask them to sit in a place where your dog has just been resting. For example, it would be seen as rude for you to tell your dog to get off the couch and then offer someone to sit in its place.\n- Often an entire family will come to a household and visit at once. Men and women will usually converse separately whilst children play in an area that does not disturb adults.\n- In Sudan, many households have two living rooms (one for each gender) where people socialise separately.\n- The Sudanese do not sit on the floor as is customary in some neighbouring cultures.

To be invited into someone\u2019s home is seen as a big honour.\n- An important distinction in Japanese homes is between the inside and outside. In many houses, there is a small space between the main door and the rest of the home that acts as an intermediate space. This entrance area is known as a \u2018genkan\u2019. The size of the\u00a0genkan\u00a0is usually proportionate to the size of the house; small houses will have a narrow\u00a0genkan\u00a0while larger houses will have a more spacious\u00a0genkan.\n- Traditionally, the main indoor space is slightly elevated and has separate flooring from the\u00a0genkan.\n- Importantly, the\u00a0genkan\u00a0is where people remove their shoes before entering the home. This is usually done as a way to avoid bringing dirt from outside into the house. It is extremely impolite to step foot past the\u00a0genkan\u00a0with outdoor shoes.\n- Outdoor shoes should be removed slowly, rather than kicked off the feet.\n- Once someone has removed their outdoor shoes, it is common practice to place the shoes on a provided shoe rack or to point the shoes towards the door.\n- Hosts will often provide guests with indoor slippers to wear while visiting the house.\n- Indoor slippers are usually worn all throughout the house except for spaces in some more traditional homes that have\u00a0tatami\u00a0mats (a type of flooring made of woven straw).\n- Some hosts may have separate slippers worn only when using the bathroom or toilet.\n- People nearly always bring a gift when visiting another person\u2019s home (see Gift Giving below for appropriate gifts).\n- Hosts usually indicate to guests where to sit when they enter a room.\n- The most important guest is offered the most honoured seat (kamiza), which is the seat furthest from the entrance.\n- The least important person present (usually the host) sits in the least honoured seat (shimoza), which is the seat closest to the entrance.\n- If the host does not indicate where to sit, the most appropriate choice is to sit closest to the entrance to demonstrate humility.\n- Some houses and restaurants in Japan follow the tradition of sitting around a low table. Sometimes, people will sit on the floor directly or on floor cushions. However, some places have a hole under the table where people can sit and hang their legs similar to if they were sitting on a chair.\n- When sitting on the floor, there are a couple of ways people are usually expected to sit.

However, hosts may put extra food on a guest\u2019s plate out of respect or prompt their guests to have more servings than they can feasibly eat. It is acceptable to decline this or leave food on your plate if you simply cannot finish the meal.\n- Some people politely leave some food on their plate at the end of the meal to indicate to the host that they have provided adequately. Otherwise, if your plate is empty, your host may keep refilling it with more helpings of food.\n- As a host, try not to eat quickly and wait until everyone has eaten a fair amount before saying you\u2019re full. It is customary for everyone to stop eating and conclude the meal once the guest is full or finished.\n- After the meal has finished, a serving of tea, fruits, sweets or coffee is commonly offered. Coffee is often served at the conclusion of a meal.

        "instruction": "### Gift Giving\n- Gift giving (z\u014dt\u014d) is quite popular in Japan. Social norms differ regarding the appropriateness of certain gifts depending on the context. The general theme underpinning gift giving practices in Japan is that there is a reciprocal cycle of obligation and gratitude. Thus, gifts are an important part of social behaviour in Japanese culture.\n- Gifts are typically given to commemorate births, graduations, house visits, weddings and anniversaries. Traditionally, gifts were not given during Christmas or for birthdays, but this is becoming much more common in Japan.\n- There are also two popular gift giving seasons in Japan that coincide with major dates of significance. The first is\u00a0Ch\u016bgen,\u00a0which occurs around the Obon festival in July, and the second is\u00a0Seibo,\u00a0which occurs near the end of the year. Department stores in Japan often sell gifts specifically for\u00a0Ch\u016bgen\u00a0and\u00a0Seibo\u00a0that are already appropriately wrapped.\n- During\u00a0Ch\u016bgen,\u00a0people usually give gifts to their social superior. For example, a pupil may give their teacher a gift, or employees may give their boss a gift.\n- During\u00a0Seibo,\u00a0gifts are usually given as a way to express gratitude to those who are important or who have helped the individual in their life or business. It is often a way to recognise favours received throughout the year.\n- Proper etiquette is to give and receive a gift with both hands.\n- When giving a gift to an individual, it is usually done in private. Gifts given to a group are usually placed in a communal area so that everyone can share the gift.\n- People tend to wait until they are indoors to give a gift. Sometimes, flowers or plants are given outside.\n- Depending on the context, it is not uncommon for people to initially refuse the gift at first. The giver then insists the recipient takes the gift. However, refusing a gift from someone who is higher ranking is generally considered rude.\n- It is inappropriate for the giver to exaggerate or boast about the gift they are giving. Rather, people tend to de-emphasise the worth of a gift.\n- Popular gifts given in Japan include flowers, plants, edible gifts (e.g. food gift baskets, chocolate, fruits, savoury snacks), alcohol, stationery, small household items (e.g. hand towels) or clothing accessories (e.g. hats or scarves). People often appreciate gifts that are not from their current location.\n- The way a gift is presented is often considered as important as the gift itself. There are a number of customs and norms relating to how a gift should be wrapped depending on the situation. Generally, gifts are wrapped and presented nicely, no matter the gift. It is also acceptable to give gifts in a nice gift bag.\n- Monetary gifts are usually given in a decorative envelope. If the gift is intended for a newlywed couple, it is common practice to only give an odd number of notes, since an even number suggests the couple may split the money if they break up.\n- It is common to find small pre-wrapped gifts in many transit places in Japan, such as airports and train stations. These may be snacks, treats, bath products or souvenirs. Such gifts are known as \u2018omiyage\u2019\u00a0or \u2018temiyage\u2019\u00a0depending on the context. The general underlying idea is that the gift is produced from a city, town, region or country different from where the gift is given.\n- Omiyage\u00a0is often translated as \u2018souvenir\u2019 but generally refers to a local product to be given as a gift. These types of gifts are usually for travellers to bring back home to family, friends and coworkers to show thoughtfulness whilst away on travel.\n- Temiyage\u00a0refers to gifts given by visitors as a way to show appreciation. For example, when visiting someone\u2019s home in Japan, a foreign visitor will give a gift from their own country.\n- It is common for the receiver to thank the giver by writing them a letter or calling them on the phone. Depending on the occasion, it is also common for people to give a small gift in return (known as\u00a0okaeshi, a 'thank-you gift'). This type of gift is usually given after a funeral, illness, wedding or birth. The value of the gift is typically half of the value of the original gift.\n- There are several gifts that are inappropriate to give, unless the recipient specifically requests the item. It is usually inappropriate to give gifts relating to fire when visiting someone\u2019s home (such as an ashtray, heater or lighter). Sharp gifts such as scissors or knives are also inappropriate as they symbolise a wish to sever a relationship. Avoid giving lilies, lotus flowers, camellias or any white flower as these are usually associated with funerals.\n- Items that predominantly display the numbers four or nine are generally considered inappropriate (see Other Considerations). For example, it would be inappropriate to give someone four boxes of biscuits, or a comb that has nine teeth.\n\nCountry: japan.\nPlease justify: During a dinner hosted by her friend, Lisa decided to present a carefully chosen and beautifully wrapped gift to her friend as soon as she entered the home.

Plans are often discussed loosely in everyday conversation to accommodate for delays (e.g.\u00a0 \u201cCome around seven\u201d or \u201cLet\u2019s\u202fmeet at about five\u201d). It is common for Ukrainians to arrive 15 to 30 minutes later than the agreed time.\n- If an important person or conversation takes longer than expected, Ukrainians tend to prioritise the person over the time.\n- Uphold any promises you make to see your Ukrainian counterpart sooner rather than later. Ukrainians tend to follow up on invitations to see friends and acquaintances quite quickly (often the same or following day from when it was offered). If you make a passing suggestion to meet, it will be expected this is organised in a timely fashion.\n- If you are unable to meet within a week or suggest a date in a few weeks time, Ukrainians may misinterpret this as a signal that you do not actually want to see them. Therefore, it important to clearly explain the circumstances as to why you cannot meet sooner and show earnest interest in maintaining the friendship\n- Ukrainians commonly refuse or protest things out of politeness. For example, it is the norm to decline an offer of food and wait for the person to offer it again. Therefore, if you say \u2018no\u2019 to a gesture, expect Ukrainians to persist in offering it again and again.\n- Repeat any offer multiple times to show that you are being sincere. It is expected that you will insist your help to show the gesture is genuine.\n- Blowing one\u2019s nose in public is considered bad manners.\n- It is impolite to yawn during conversations with others, or in public without covering your mouth.\n- Throwing away food or wasting food is frowned upon, especially bread. Ukrainians tend to repurpose leftovers (e.g. by leaving them outside for stray dogs or birds to eat).\n- It is inappropriate for strangers to approach someone else\u2019s child. Close contact or friendliness is frowned upon if you do not know the child (e.g. patting the head or shoulder).\n- It is polite to offer one\u2019s seat to an elderly person, pregnant woman or children in public spaces.\n- It is respectful to assist older people using transport. Ukrainians may offer their hand to help an elderly person get out of their seat, offer an arm for them to walk, and hold or open doors for them.\n- It is the norm for Ukrainian men to open doors for women and allow them to enter first. Ukrainian women may similarly expect men to perform this chivalry as a mark of politeness.\n- There is a large tipping culture in Ukraine. It is the norm to tip\u202fat least 10% after a meal. Some restaurants may include the tip in the total bill.\n- It is uncommon to split the bill\u202fevenly in social scenarios.

People visit one another to celebrate events, catch up on community news and also to commiserate and support each other through hard times. For example, it is customary for a grieving household to receive visitors consistently for three days after a death.\n- There are many differences between Palestinian family homes.\u00a0Customs can also vary depending on the formality of the visit or your relationship with the person. Nevertheless, you can expect to be welcomed and received with hospitality.\n- It is best to arrange a time to meet to allow your host time to prepare for your visit, although relatives and close friends may visit one another regularly without giving notice.\n- Common expressions of welcome include \u201cAhlan wa sahlan\u201d (You are welcome here) and \u201cTafadal\u201d (\"Please\" meaning \u2018Come in\u2019, \u2018Sit down\u2019 or \u2018Help yourself\u2019 depending where the person is gesturing).\n- It is polite to bring a gift whenever invited to a Palestinian home. See\u00a0Gift Giving below for more information.\n- Expect to be offered a drink (e.g. tea, juice) and snacks (e.g. cake, nuts, fruit) as a gesture of hospitality during your visit. This is generally followed by coffee.\n- If a visit extends in length, a Palestinian host may also invite guests to join the upcoming household meal (see\u00a0Eating below).\n- It is courteous to make positive comments on your host\u2019s hospitality and home (e.g. the view from a window, the location of their home, cleanliness or the general d\u00e9cor). However, be careful not to compliment a specific object or item too heavily, as it is customary for your host to offer it as a gift. If they try to give it to you, insist that you appreciate their gesture but do not want to take it. A Palestinian is likely to offer the object out of politeness and may end up giving you something they wished to keep if you accept.\n- While many Palestinians are not concerned with gender segregation, some religiously conservative families may require men and women to socialise in separate rooms.\n- Do not explore a person\u2019s house or enter rooms you have never been in before without being invited to. This includes looking for the bathroom. Always notify your host so that they can give other family members time to clear from the area if they\u2019d like to maintain their privacy.\n- Palestinians generally feel uncomfortable directly asking someone to leave their home. Therefore, try to read non-verbal cues in order not to overstay your welcome.\n- Towards the end of a visit, it is customary for the host to ask the guest to stay for coffee.

In Saudi Arabia, many households have two different \u2018majlis\u2019 (living room/place of sitting/private place for discussion) so men and women can socialise separately.\n- Once segregated from the men, the women of both families can unveil in front of one another.\n- Men give women notice before entering an area of the house where unrelated women are socialising to give them time to cover up.

Brazilians will typically walk ahead in lines or cut people off when driving. This attitude, whilst common in the anonymous public space, differs from their attitudes of respect towards people within their own social circle.\n- When it comes to queuing etiquette, the notion of \u2018first come, first serve\u2019 does not always apply. Cutting in line may be tolerated if the person who comes later believes they are more important than others in line, or they know someone who can assist with jumping the line. For example, \u2018doutor fulano\u2019 (\u2018doctor so-and-so\u2019) may cut in front because the person serving is a patient of theirs. These intricate dynamics determine not only who is next in line, but also who generally excels in society.\n- Given large family sizes and typically small living quarters, Brazilians are generally not demanding regarding their privacy. Within one family, possessions are typically thought to be communal and \u00a0are shared amongst everyone. Thus, it is expected to be open about one\u2019s possessions and space.\n\nCountry: brazil.\nPlease justify: During a visit to her friend's house, Anna noticed her friend's new book on the coffee table.

Plans are often discussed loosely in everyday conversation to accommodate for delays (e.g.\u00a0 \u201cCome around seven\u201d or \u201cLet\u2019s\u202fmeet at about five\u201d). It is common for Ukrainians to arrive 15 to 30 minutes later than the agreed time.\n- If an important person or conversation takes longer than expected, Ukrainians tend to prioritise the person over the time.\n- Uphold any promises you make to see your Ukrainian counterpart sooner rather than later. Ukrainians tend to follow up on invitations to see friends and acquaintances quite quickly (often the same or following day from when it was offered). If you make a passing suggestion to meet, it will be expected this is organised in a timely fashion.\n- If you are unable to meet within a week or suggest a date in a few weeks time, Ukrainians may misinterpret this as a signal that you do not actually want to see them. Therefore, it important to clearly explain the circumstances as to why you cannot meet sooner and show earnest interest in maintaining the friendship\n- Ukrainians commonly refuse or protest things out of politeness. For example, it is the norm to decline an offer of food and wait for the person to offer it again. Therefore, if you say \u2018no\u2019 to a gesture, expect Ukrainians to persist in offering it again and again.\n- Repeat any offer multiple times to show that you are being sincere. It is expected that you will insist your help to show the gesture is genuine.\n- Blowing one\u2019s nose in public is considered bad manners.\n- It is impolite to yawn during conversations with others, or in public without covering your mouth.\n- Throwing away food or wasting food is frowned upon, especially bread. Ukrainians tend to repurpose leftovers (e.g. by leaving them outside for stray dogs or birds to eat).\n- It is inappropriate for strangers to approach someone else\u2019s child. Close contact or friendliness is frowned upon if you do not know the child (e.g. patting the head or shoulder).\n- It is polite to offer one\u2019s seat to an elderly person, pregnant woman or children in public spaces.\n- It is respectful to assist older people using transport. Ukrainians may offer their hand to help an elderly person get out of their seat, offer an arm for them to walk, and hold or open doors for them.\n- It is the norm for Ukrainian men to open doors for women and allow them to enter first. Ukrainian women may similarly expect men to perform this chivalry as a mark of politeness.\n- There is a large tipping culture in Ukraine. It is the norm to tip\u202fat least 10% after a meal. Some restaurants may include the tip in the total bill.\n- It is uncommon to split the bill\u202fevenly in social scenarios. Typically, the person who invited people to the meal pays for the total bill or each person\u202fpays for their own order.\n\nCountry: ukraine.\nPlease justify: During a gathering at Sara's house, she offered her guest, Tom, a piece of homemade cake.

People feel a duty to offer anything else within their means. Even if a family has no food to provide a guest, they are expected to at least offer water.\n- It is very important to accept any refreshment (typically coffee/tea) as a mark of friendship. Non-acceptance would be perceived as highly offensive and could create misunderstanding even if you are simply not thirsty.\n- Social visiting and hosting has a great importance for building and mending relations among friends and family members. Not visiting someone for a long period of time is considered a sign of the relationship\u2019s insignificance. People may also choose not to visit someone on purpose to indirectly reveal that they are angry/offended at something the person has done.\n- If you are unable to visit a friend for a long period of time, make contact by phone to keep the relationship alive and make it known that you are not ignoring them.\n- Close friends, family and neighbours may visit one another frequently unannounced, especially in rural areas. However, busy schedules mean that most visits among broader friends are planned in advance.\n- Friday is the most popular day for visits, as it is a holy day of rest in Sudan.\n- Guests usually arrive at mid-morning or early evening to avoid interrupting a family meal. If you do happen to arrive during meal time, you will be asked to join them at the table. In this case, only accept a small amount of food.\n- Make sure your house is clean before inviting a Sudanese person over. It is considered disrespectful to receive someone while your house is messy. They may feel that you do not care about their opinion of you.\n- Be mindful that a Sudanese person\u2019s home is also their private place for prayer. Therefore, it is important to be clean and respectful.\n- Remove your shoes when entering someone\u2019s home unless advised otherwise.\n- Dogs are considered unclean in Sudan and are not meant to be let into areas where people pray (i.e. homes). Therefore, people rarely bring them inside their houses in Sudan and it\u2019s not common to have them as pets. Let your Sudanese counterpart know in advance if you have a pet dog. Do not ask them to sit in a place where your dog has just been resting. For example, it would be seen as rude for you to tell your dog to get off the couch and then offer someone to sit in its place.\n- Often an entire family will come to a household and visit at once. Men and women will usually converse separately whilst children play in an area that does not disturb adults.\n- In Sudan, many households have two living rooms (one for each gender) where people socialise separately.\n- The Sudanese do not sit on the floor as is customary in some neighbouring cultures. They sit on chairs and couches in their living rooms.\n- When it is time for a visitor to leave, the host usually walks them out to the door or gate. Conversation can continue here for a long time before the person actually leaves.\n\nCountry: sudan.\nPlease justify: During a visit to Sarah's house, she offered Tom a cup of tea.

Complimenting or praising something too heavily can cause some Saudis to be wary that the evil eye will be jealous of it or curse it. People say \u201cMashallah\u201d (May God bless) to ward off the evil eye after a compliment and avoid hurting people\u2019s feelings. This phrase comforts people as it lets them know that you are giving an innocent compliment and do not wish harm. Expect to hear it highly frequently in conversation, and say it after every compliment.\n- In Saudi Arabia, people generally extend an offer multiple times. It is often polite to decline gestures initially and accept once the person has insisted. This exchange allows the offering person to show their sincerity in the gesture, and shows the receiver\u2019s humbleness.\n- Be sure to offer everything multiple times in return. If you only offer something once, a Saudi person may respond, \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay\u201d, out of modesty and politeness even though they meant to accept on the second offer.\n- Be careful when you compliment an item in a Saudi person\u2019s house, as they may feel compelled to offer it to you as a gift. If they try to give it to you, insist that you appreciate their gesture but do not want to take it. A Saudi person is likely to offer the object out of politeness, and if you accept, they may end up giving you something they wished to keep.\n- It is thought to be more sincere if compliments are given out of sight or earshot of the person who owns the possession or thing you are praising.\n- Show gratitude and humility when offered a compliment.

It refers to the quality of being thoughtful and considerate of others in such a way that the host can anticipate the needs of their guests or customers and adjust accordingly. Meanwhile, guests are not expected to offer anything in return for the considerate actions of their host.\n- Two common phrases used to indicate politeness are \u201cGomen nasai\u201d (\u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019) and \u201cSumimasen\u201d (\u2018Excuse me\u2019). It is considered proper etiquette to state these phrases when you have made a mistake or caused inconvenience. Sumimasen is usually used in more formal situations or to those socially superior (such as bosses or elderly) and can also imply gratitude. Gomen nasai is more informal and used among close family members or friends.\n- It is common in Japan for people to wear face masks, generally as a way to protect against colds. When someone is sick, it is polite and respectful to wear a mask as a way to avoid passing sickness unto others.\n- People usually walk on the left side of a path, especially in busy areas. Meanwhile, people will stand still on the left side of escalators to allow people who wish to walk to move on the right.\n- Japanese businesses often leave a small tray near the cash register for the customer to place their money. This ensures that the cashier does not need to directly come into contact with the customer. Disregarding the money tray and holding money out for the cashier to take is considered highly impolite.\n- It is considered rude to count the received change in front of a cashier. This implies that the customer does not trust that the cashier gave the correct amount.\n- Punctuality is extremely valued in Japan. Being on time for meetings, appointments, services and parties is expected. This expectation is carried through to services, such as public transport arriving exactly at the expected time. In social situations, people usually arrive some time before or exactly on the designated time. If you expect a delay, politely inform your Japanese counterpart.\n\nCountry: japan.\nPlease justify: Alice had arranged to meet her friend Ben at a caf\u00e9 at 3 PM.

This \u2018reserves\u2019 their spot so they can do something else until it is their turn.\n- Dress neatly and tidily. Footwear for sporting activities should not be worn to enter restaurants or bars. One may be refused entry if wearing these shoes.\n- Talking to someone whilst keeping your hands in your pockets is rude.\n- Do not spread your legs wide apart when sitting.\n- It\u2019s normal to be actively pushed when standing in crowds, lines or public transport.\n- Russians commonly take a brief pause to silently reflect and recall whether they have everything before leaving on a trip.\n- It can be very rude to act too casual or informally towards a stranger. It\u2019s not always appreciated to assume familiarity before you are close with them. For example, calling someone by a nickname or using an informal pronoun to talk to someone you are not close with is disrespectful.\n- Russians are generally punctual; however, they tend to see time as rather fluid.

        "instruction": "### Basic Etiquette\n- An important concept that informs etiquette in Japan is omotenashi, which generally translates as \u2018hospitality\u2019. It refers to the quality of being thoughtful and considerate of others in such a way that the host can anticipate the needs of their guests or customers and adjust accordingly. Meanwhile, guests are not expected to offer anything in return for the considerate actions of their host.\n- Two common phrases used to indicate politeness are \u201cGomen nasai\u201d (\u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019) and \u201cSumimasen\u201d (\u2018Excuse me\u2019). It is considered proper etiquette to state these phrases when you have made a mistake or caused inconvenience. Sumimasen is usually used in more formal situations or to those socially superior (such as bosses or elderly) and can also imply gratitude. Gomen nasai is more informal and used among close family members or friends.\n- It is common in Japan for people to wear face masks, generally as a way to protect against colds. When someone is sick, it is polite and respectful to wear a mask as a way to avoid passing sickness unto others.\n- People usually walk on the left side of a path, especially in busy areas. Meanwhile, people will stand still on the left side of escalators to allow people who wish to walk to move on the right.\n- Japanese businesses often leave a small tray near the cash register for the customer to place their money. This ensures that the cashier does not need to directly come into contact with the customer. Disregarding the money tray and holding money out for the cashier to take is considered highly impolite.\n- It is considered rude to count the received change in front of a cashier. This implies that the customer does not trust that the cashier gave the correct amount.\n- Punctuality is extremely valued in Japan. Being on time for meetings, appointments, services and parties is expected. This expectation is carried through to services, such as public transport arriving exactly at the expected time. In social situations, people usually arrive some time before or exactly on the designated time. If you expect a delay, politely inform your Japanese counterpart.\n\nCountry: japan.\nPlease justify: During her visit to a local cafe, Emily noticed a small tray near the cash register.

        "instruction": "### Gift Giving\n- Gift giving (z\u014dt\u014d) is quite popular in Japan. Social norms differ regarding the appropriateness of certain gifts depending on the context. The general theme underpinning gift giving practices in Japan is that there is a reciprocal cycle of obligation and gratitude. Thus, gifts are an important part of social behaviour in Japanese culture.\n- Gifts are typically given to commemorate births, graduations, house visits, weddings and anniversaries. Traditionally, gifts were not given during Christmas or for birthdays, but this is becoming much more common in Japan.\n- There are also two popular gift giving seasons in Japan that coincide with major dates of significance. The first is\u00a0Ch\u016bgen,\u00a0which occurs around the Obon festival in July, and the second is\u00a0Seibo,\u00a0which occurs near the end of the year. Department stores in Japan often sell gifts specifically for\u00a0Ch\u016bgen\u00a0and\u00a0Seibo\u00a0that are already appropriately wrapped.\n- During\u00a0Ch\u016bgen,\u00a0people usually give gifts to their social superior. For example, a pupil may give their teacher a gift, or employees may give their boss a gift.\n- During\u00a0Seibo,\u00a0gifts are usually given as a way to express gratitude to those who are important or who have helped the individual in their life or business. It is often a way to recognise favours received throughout the year.\n- Proper etiquette is to give and receive a gift with both hands.\n- When giving a gift to an individual, it is usually done in private. Gifts given to a group are usually placed in a communal area so that everyone can share the gift.\n- People tend to wait until they are indoors to give a gift. Sometimes, flowers or plants are given outside.\n- Depending on the context, it is not uncommon for people to initially refuse the gift at first. The giver then insists the recipient takes the gift. However, refusing a gift from someone who is higher ranking is generally considered rude.\n- It is inappropriate for the giver to exaggerate or boast about the gift they are giving. Rather, people tend to de-emphasise the worth of a gift.\n- Popular gifts given in Japan include flowers, plants, edible gifts (e.g. food gift baskets, chocolate, fruits, savoury snacks), alcohol, stationery, small household items (e.g. hand towels) or clothing accessories (e.g. hats or scarves). People often appreciate gifts that are not from their current location.\n- The way a gift is presented is often considered as important as the gift itself. There are a number of customs and norms relating to how a gift should be wrapped depending on the situation. Generally, gifts are wrapped and presented nicely, no matter the gift. It is also acceptable to give gifts in a nice gift bag.\n- Monetary gifts are usually given in a decorative envelope. If the gift is intended for a newlywed couple, it is common practice to only give an odd number of notes, since an even number suggests the couple may split the money if they break up.\n- It is common to find small pre-wrapped gifts in many transit places in Japan, such as airports and train stations. These may be snacks, treats, bath products or souvenirs. Such gifts are known as \u2018omiyage\u2019\u00a0or \u2018temiyage\u2019\u00a0depending on the context. The general underlying idea is that the gift is produced from a city, town, region or country different from where the gift is given.\n- Omiyage\u00a0is often translated as \u2018souvenir\u2019 but generally refers to a local product to be given as a gift. These types of gifts are usually for travellers to bring back home to family, friends and coworkers to show thoughtfulness whilst away on travel.\n- Temiyage\u00a0refers to gifts given by visitors as a way to show appreciation. For example, when visiting someone\u2019s home in Japan, a foreign visitor will give a gift from their own country.\n- It is common for the receiver to thank the giver by writing them a letter or calling them on the phone. Depending on the occasion, it is also common for people to give a small gift in return (known as\u00a0okaeshi, a 'thank-you gift'). This type of gift is usually given after a funeral, illness, wedding or birth. The value of the gift is typically half of the value of the original gift.\n- There are several gifts that are inappropriate to give, unless the recipient specifically requests the item. It is usually inappropriate to give gifts relating to fire when visiting someone\u2019s home (such as an ashtray, heater or lighter). Sharp gifts such as scissors or knives are also inappropriate as they symbolise a wish to sever a relationship. Avoid giving lilies, lotus flowers, camellias or any white flower as these are usually associated with funerals.\n- Items that predominantly display the numbers four or nine are generally considered inappropriate (see Other Considerations). For example, it would be inappropriate to give someone four boxes of biscuits, or a comb that has nine teeth.\n\nCountry: japan.\nPlease justify: Alice arrived at her friend's house for a dinner party.

When a person is about to have a meal, they usually announce it to let others gather so they can all say a blessing and eat together.\n- Table service can take a long time at Fijian restaurants. Be patient and refrain from shouting to summon people\u2019s attention.

Complimenting or praising something too heavily can cause some Saudis to be wary that the evil eye will be jealous of it or curse it. People say \u201cMashallah\u201d (May God bless) to ward off the evil eye after a compliment and avoid hurting people\u2019s feelings. This phrase comforts people as it lets them know that you are giving an innocent compliment and do not wish harm. Expect to hear it highly frequently in conversation, and say it after every compliment.\n- In Saudi Arabia, people generally extend an offer multiple times. It is often polite to decline gestures initially and accept once the person has insisted. This exchange allows the offering person to show their sincerity in the gesture, and shows the receiver\u2019s humbleness.\n- Be sure to offer everything multiple times in return. If you only offer something once, a Saudi person may respond, \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay\u201d, out of modesty and politeness even though they meant to accept on the second offer.\n- Be careful when you compliment an item in a Saudi person\u2019s house, as they may feel compelled to offer it to you as a gift. If they try to give it to you, insist that you appreciate their gesture but do not want to take it. A Saudi person is likely to offer the object out of politeness, and if you accept, they may end up giving you something they wished to keep.\n- It is thought to be more sincere if compliments are given out of sight or earshot of the person who owns the possession or thing you are praising.\n- Show gratitude and humility when offered a compliment. This is done by responding with an equally respectful compliment on the same subject.

For example, southern-style cooking (often called \"American comfort food\") includes dishes such as fried chicken, collard greens and cornbread.\n- Cuisines may also differ depending on the dominant migration populations in the region. For example, it is common to find a blend of South American and Mexican cooking styles throughout the states closer to Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico. This includes items such as chilli and burritos, and relies heavily on shredded cheese and beans.\n- Wait until everyone has been seated and served before eating. The host often indicates when it is time to begin.\n- In some religious households, families may say a blessing before beginning to eat (known as saying \u2018grace\u2019).\n- In homes, dishes are usually passed around so that each person can get a share of food. If you find you do not want one of the dishes being passed around, it is acceptable to refuse by just continuing to pass it along.\n- Ask for someone to pass a dish to you instead of reaching across the table to grab it.\n- Napkins should be placed on your lap and kept there during the meal.\n- Americans use cutlery to eat food unless eating certain fast foods.\n- Hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right hand when cutting food. After cutting a bite-sized portion, the knife is placed down and the fork is swapped to the right hand to stab or scoop the food. Food is placed into the mouth with the fork tongs curving in the upward direction.\n- Note that this American norm of swapping the fork between hands differs from the European use of cutlery where the fork remains in the left hand and food is placed in the mouth with tongs facing downwards.\n- Do not cut up all the food on your plate at once. This is the way food is fed to young children.\n- The pause to swap the fork between hands to cut food slows down eating and allows for more conversation over the meal.\n- Americans have a distinct set of \u2018finger-foods\u2019 which are expected to be eaten with fingers, such as pizza, tacos or burgers. They may think it is strange or unusual if you eat pizza with a fork or cut a burrito into smaller bites.\n- It is polite to offer to refill other people\u2019s drinks or pass them dishes at the table.\n- It is rude to eat with your mouth open, lick your plate, bowl or knife, talk while there is still food in your mouth, burp out loud, or lick food off your fingers.\n- It is acceptable to mop up any remaining food in your plate/bowl with bread that was served as part of the meal. This is a sign that you enjoyed the meal and is a compliment to the cook.\n- Guests may accept second servings when offered. This indicates they find the meal tasty and appreciate the hosts generosity.\n- Children will frequently be seated at a separate \u2018kids table\u2019, allowing adults to have more discreet conversations over meals. Children will sometimes be presented with a different menu selection of simpler foods and may eat at a different (usually earlier) time.\n- If children are seated at the same table as adults, they may ask to be excused from the table once they have finished eating. This is a polite way of exiting if they do not wish to sit quietly or join in the adult conversation.\n- American restaurants tend to serve quite large portion sizes. It is acceptable to ask to have any left-over food repackaged to take home with you after eating out.\n- If eating the meal in someone\u2019s home, it is polite for guests to offer to help clear the table or wipe up dishes after the meal to reciprocate the host\u2019s generosity and show gratitude.\n\nCountry: united_states_of_america.\nPlease justify: After enjoying a lovely dinner at her friend Lisa's house, Emily offered to help clear the table and wash the dishes.

To be invited into someone\u2019s home is seen as a big honour.\n- An important distinction in Japanese homes is between the inside and outside. In many houses, there is a small space between the main door and the rest of the home that acts as an intermediate space. This entrance area is known as a \u2018genkan\u2019. The size of the\u00a0genkan\u00a0is usually proportionate to the size of the house; small houses will have a narrow\u00a0genkan\u00a0while larger houses will have a more spacious\u00a0genkan.\n- Traditionally, the main indoor space is slightly elevated and has separate flooring from the\u00a0genkan.\n- Importantly, the\u00a0genkan\u00a0is where people remove their shoes before entering the home. This is usually done as a way to avoid bringing dirt from outside into the house. It is extremely impolite to step foot past the\u00a0genkan\u00a0with outdoor shoes.\n- Outdoor shoes should be removed slowly, rather than kicked off the feet.\n- Once someone has removed their outdoor shoes, it is common practice to place the shoes on a provided shoe rack or to point the shoes towards the door.\n- Hosts will often provide guests with indoor slippers to wear while visiting the house.\n- Indoor slippers are usually worn all throughout the house except for spaces in some more traditional homes that have\u00a0tatami\u00a0mats (a type of flooring made of woven straw).\n- Some hosts may have separate slippers worn only when using the bathroom or toilet.\n- People nearly always bring a gift when visiting another person\u2019s home (see Gift Giving below for appropriate gifts).\n- Hosts usually indicate to guests where to sit when they enter a room.\n- The most important guest is offered the most honoured seat (kamiza), which is the seat furthest from the entrance.\n- The least important person present (usually the host) sits in the least honoured seat (shimoza), which is the seat closest to the entrance.\n- If the host does not indicate where to sit, the most appropriate choice is to sit closest to the entrance to demonstrate humility.\n- Some houses and restaurants in Japan follow the tradition of sitting around a low table. Sometimes, people will sit on the floor directly or on floor cushions. However, some places have a hole under the table where people can sit and hang their legs similar to if they were sitting on a chair.\n- When sitting on the floor, there are a couple of ways people are usually expected to sit. The formal Japanese sitting position is known as \u2018seiza\u2019.\u00a0In this position, people sit with their legs tucked under their thighs while resting their bottom on the heels and maintaining a straight back. Women usually keep their knees together, while men have their knees slightly apart.\n- In casual situations, men usually sit on the floor with their legs crossed, while women sit with both legs to one side.\n\nCountry: japan.\nPlease justify: At a dinner party at Sarah's house, Michael carefully removed his shoes before stepping inside and made sure to point them towards the door.

However, there is a level of modesty expected in day-to-day clothing. For example, it is not appropriate to be barefoot in public.\u00a0It is advisable for women to dress modestly, ensuring their legs, arms and shoulders are covered.\n- Timekeeping is much looser than in English-speaking Western countries. For example, someone saying, \u201cI will be there soon\u201d does not necessarily mean that they are on their way.

It is considered shameful for a woman to pay for a man.\n- If the bill is for two people of the same gender, generally the person who invited the other will pay. Otherwise, both individuals will usually compete with one another with one person conceding to let the other pay for them under the agreement that they will cover all costs during their next outing.\n- Some people may also expect those who are substantially wealthier to pay for others with more modest incomes. However, it is polite not to order expensive items or dishes when there is an understanding that you are not the person paying for them.\n- It is polite to use the right hand (or both hands together) to gesture, touch people or offer items. According to Islamic principles, the left hand should be used for hygiene purposes. Therefore, it is considered more unclean and should not be used for functions such as waving, eating or offering items.\n- Avoid eating, drinking or smoking in front of a Muslim during the fasting hours of Ramadan.

This custom is tied to Islamic principles that prescribe the left hand should be used for removal of dirt and for cleaning. It should not be used for functions such as waving, eating or passing items. Therefore, one should gesture, touch people or offer items using both hands together. Using the one hand alone can seem too informal, but if doing so, use the right.\n- Tipping is common in Saudi Arabia, but it is not routine. It is also not required if a service charge is already included in the bill. Saudis usually tip expatriate service people and individual services in hotels despite the overall service charge. For example, it is appropriate to leave $1-2USD for a porter or housekeeper.\n- Punctuality depends on the priority of the occasion. Saudi Arabians generally have a more relaxed approach to time-keeping in casual settings. People do not adhere to tight schedules and are quite tolerant of lateness when meeting with friends. However, punctuality is expected and adhered to in professional settings (see Business Culture).\n- It is considered rude to check the time whilst in conversation with someone or at a social gathering. Time spent with friends is considered time well spent.\n- Ask permission before taking anyone\u2019s photo or posting it online, especially if they are a woman.\n- Avoid sitting in any position that allows one\u2019s shoe to face another person. This is considered insulting. Similarly, it is inappropriate to cross your legs when facing someone.\n- Try to avoid situations in which you will be left alone with a member of the opposite gender (e.g. elevators, cars). If a woman is in a car alone with a male driver, she may sit in the backseat behind the driver\u2019s seat out of his view.\n- Avoid wearing tight clothes that accentuate the shape of your body or legs. Most Saudis are accustomed to seeing Western clothing. However, it is advisable to ensure your legs, arms and shoulders are covered. Women are recommended to wear a\u00a0hair/head scarf covering\u00a0if visiting Saudi Arabia.\n- Pay respect to elderly in all situations. For example, standing up when they enter a room or offering them your seat.\n- It is polite to avoid blowing one\u2019s nose or spitting in public.\n- Casual whistling has suggestive connotations and may be seen as inappropriate depending on the context.\n- Loud aggression and/or drunkenness is looked upon very poorly.\n\nCountry: saudi_arabia.\nPlease justify: During a dinner party at her friend's house, Emily used her left hand to pass the salt to someone sitting across the table.

This means they must not come into contact with sacred objects, people or spaces.\n- Do not bring food into any buildings, spaces or places considered tapu, such as the wharenui (traditional meeting house) in a marae (traditional M\u0101ori meeting ground).\n- Food should not be passed over an individual\u2019s head.\n- It is a cultural taboo to sit on tables, countertops or other surfaces that are used for food preparation or eating.\n- There may be ritual protocols to bless or cleanse a tapu space or place before you enter, such as reciting a karakia or cleansing the area with water.\n- Ask a M\u0101ori person\u2019s permission before photographing, filming or taping them.\n- Some Maori communities may not allow digital recording devices into their marae (traditional meeting ground) or other sites of significance. Recording these places without permission can be a violation of tapu.6\n- Some M\u0101ori have tribal tattoos on their faces, arms and calves that have cultural and spiritual significance. These do not hold negative connotations (i.e. prison sentences) as they do in some other cultures. All traditional M\u0101ori tribal tattoos are deeply personal and unique to the individual\u2019s tribal group, representing important family history and/or tribal narratives.\n- The wearing of pounamu (greenstone) and/or bone necklaces is common practice among M\u0101ori. The shape of each pounamu carries important meaning.\n- It is appropriate to ask about the significance of a person\u2019s pounamu if you are interested.\n- Non-M\u0101ori may wear pounamu if they have been gifted it. To be gifted a piece signifies much about the value and respect between the giver and receiver.7\n- It is not uncommon for non-M\u0101ori New Zealanders to wear pounamu or get M\u0101ori-inspired tattoos. However, this is often for aesthetic purposes, as opposed to traditional cultural practices.\n- While it is not necessarily culturally inappropriate for non-M\u0101ori to purchase pounamu for themselves, it is generally advised against as it diminishes the cultural significance behind gifted possession.\n\nCountry: new_zealand.\nPlease justify: During a visit to a friend's house, Emily was intrigued by an intricately carved box on the mantle.

However, there is a level of modesty expected in day-to-day clothing. For example, it is not appropriate to be barefoot in public.\u00a0It is advisable for women to dress modestly, ensuring their legs, arms and shoulders are covered.\n- Timekeeping is much looser than in English-speaking Western countries. For example, someone saying, \u201cI will be there soon\u201d does not necessarily mean that they are on their way. It is advisable to ask a person for a specific estimated time of arrival.\n- Many Palestinian men are raised to show chivalry, respect and honour to women by\u00a0opening doors, giving them their seat and carrying items for them.\n- If one offers an invitation to someone, it can often imply that their entire family is invited. It is good to clarify this beforehand.\n- People do not split bills in Palestinian culture. When people go out to dinner or an event, there is a general expectation that men pay for women. It is considered shameful for a woman to pay for a man.\n- If the bill is for two people of the same gender, generally the person who invited the other will pay. Otherwise, both individuals will usually compete with one another with one person conceding to let the other pay for them under the agreement that they will cover all costs during their next outing.\n- Some people may also expect those who are substantially wealthier to pay for others with more modest incomes. However, it is polite not to order expensive items or dishes when there is an understanding that you are not the person paying for them.\n- It is polite to use the right hand (or both hands together) to gesture, touch people or offer items. According to Islamic principles, the left hand should be used for hygiene purposes. Therefore, it is considered more unclean and should not be used for functions such as waving, eating or offering items.\n- Avoid eating, drinking or smoking in front of a Muslim during the fasting hours of Ramadan. In Muslim-majority countries, it is considered disrespectful (and often legally forbidden) to engage in these activities in public.\n- It is very rude to attempt to talk to or walk in front of someone who is praying.\n- Avoid having private conversations with unrelated members of the opposite gender, or being alone together in a confined space (e.g. a car).\n- Do not flirt or make comments about how good-looking someone from the opposite sex is.\n- Present yourself in a clean and tidy manner.

This custom is tied to Islamic principles that prescribe the left hand should be used for removal of dirt and for cleaning.

Using the one hand alone can seem too informal, but if doing so, use the right.\n- Tipping is common in Saudi Arabia, but it is not routine. It is also not required if a service charge is already included in the bill. Saudis usually tip expatriate service people and individual services in hotels despite the overall service charge. For example, it is appropriate to leave $1-2USD for a porter or housekeeper.\n- Punctuality depends on the priority of the occasion. Saudi Arabians generally have a more relaxed approach to time-keeping in casual settings. People do not adhere to tight schedules and are quite tolerant of lateness when meeting with friends. However, punctuality is expected and adhered to in professional settings (see Business Culture).\n- It is considered rude to check the time whilst in conversation with someone or at a social gathering. Time spent with friends is considered time well spent.\n- Ask permission before taking anyone\u2019s photo or posting it online, especially if they are a woman.\n- Avoid sitting in any position that allows one\u2019s shoe to face another person. This is considered insulting. Similarly, it is inappropriate to cross your legs when facing someone.\n- Try to avoid situations in which you will be left alone with a member of the opposite gender (e.g. elevators, cars). If a woman is in a car alone with a male driver, she may sit in the backseat behind the driver\u2019s seat out of his view.\n- Avoid wearing tight clothes that accentuate the shape of your body or legs.

Complimenting or praising something too heavily can cause some Saudis to be wary that the evil eye will be jealous of it or curse it. People say \u201cMashallah\u201d (May God bless) to ward off the evil eye after a compliment and avoid hurting people\u2019s feelings. This phrase comforts people as it lets them know that you are giving an innocent compliment and do not wish harm. Expect to hear it highly frequently in conversation, and say it after every compliment.\n- In Saudi Arabia, people generally extend an offer multiple times. It is often polite to decline gestures initially and accept once the person has insisted. This exchange allows the offering person to show their sincerity in the gesture, and shows the receiver\u2019s humbleness.\n- Be sure to offer everything multiple times in return. If you only offer something once, a Saudi person may respond, \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay\u201d, out of modesty and politeness even though they meant to accept on the second offer.\n- Be careful when you compliment an item in a Saudi person\u2019s house, as they may feel compelled to offer it to you as a gift. If they try to give it to you, insist that you appreciate their gesture but do not want to take it. A Saudi person is likely to offer the object out of politeness, and if you accept, they may end up giving you something they wished to keep.\n- It is thought to be more sincere if compliments are given out of sight or earshot of the person who owns the possession or thing you are praising.\n- Show gratitude and humility when offered a compliment. This is done by responding with an equally respectful compliment on the same subject. If they are Muslim, you may wish them Allah\u2019s (God\u2019s) blessings.\n\nCountry: saudi_arabia.\nPlease justify: During a visit to Sarah's house, Emily admired a beautiful vase on the coffee table. \u201cThis vase is absolutely gorgeous!\u201d Emily exclaimed without any additional remarks.

Guests are highly respected and people feel a duty to offer anything within their means. Even if a family has no food to provide a guest, they are expected to at least offer water.\n- Guests are always offered refreshments, typically tea. It is very important to accept any drink offered as a mark of friendship. Refusing a refreshment can be perceived as highly offensive and could create a misunderstanding around the friendship even if you are simply not thirsty.\n- Close friends, family and neighbours may visit one another frequently unannounced. A Somali may face some adjustment in having to arrange a time to meet.\n- Social visiting and hosting holds great importance in building and mending relations among friends and family members. Not visiting someone for a long period of time is considered a sign of the relationship\u2019s insignificance. People may also choose not to visit someone on purpose to indirectly reveal that they are angry/offended at something the person has done.\n- Be mindful that a Somali person\u2019s home is also their private place for prayer. Therefore, it is important to be clean and respectful.\n- Remove your shoes when entering someone\u2019s home unless advised otherwise.\n- Dogs are considered unclean in Somalia and are generally not allowed in areas where people pray (i.e. homes). Therefore, people rarely bring them inside their houses in Somalia and it\u2019s not common to have them as pets. Let your Somali counterpart know in advance if you have a pet dog. Do not ask them to sit in a place where your dog has just been resting. For example, it would be seen as rude for you to tell your dog to get off the couch and then offer someone to sit in its place.\n- Often an entire family will come to a household and visit at once. Men and women will usually converse separately whilst children play in an area that does not disturb adults.\n- Sometimes women will visit one another at home alone. If men want to socialise together, they often go to tea shops.\n- In Somalia, many households have two living rooms (one for each gender) where people socialise separately.\n- Visits can go on for hours. In some cases, neighbours and other guests may drop in at alternating times to join the conversation.\n- Expect goodbyes to be prolonged as people farewell everyone individually and the host walks you outside. Sometimes conversation can continue outside the guest\u2019s car for a couple of minutes.\n\nCountry: somalia.\nPlease justify: Alice visited her friend's house for the first time.

It is advisable to abstain from drinking alcohol altogether if you are hosted by Saudi Arabians to avoid potential embarrassment or offence.\n- Pork is also prohibited in Islam. Do not serve food containing pork or pork byproducts (e.g. gelatine) to your Saudi counterpart.\n- It is polite to avoid eating, drinking or smoking in front of a Muslim during the daylight hours of the fasting month of Ramadan. In Saudi Arabia, it is considered disrespectful to engage in these activities in public.\n- Saudis often prepare more food than what their guests will be able to feasibly eat. Hosts often encourage guests to have second helpings and eat more even if they are full.\n- Try to taste all dishes on offer. Not eating very much can be perceived as rude or a sign that the food tastes bad.\n- It is important to wash your hands thoroughly before and after eating.\n- Food can either be served on a large plate set on the floor or on a table.\n- If the meal is on the floor, it is set on a thin plastic sheet (1m x 1m) to protect the carpet from the food. People sit cross-legged or kneel on one knee around the sheet. Keep your feet away from the cloth or plastic sheet.\n- When seated at a table, the most honoured seating position is in the middle of the table. Guests usually sit next to the head of the family. Do not take your seat until the eldest/most senior person has sat down.\n- Older restaurants may have two sections, one for men and one for families (where women and families are seated in a separate, partitioned arrangement). Newer restaurants usually have a mixed-gender open plan, that still provide the option for families to be segregated. A sign out front will indicate whether a restaurant is segregated. If there is no sign, it is usually mixed.\n- People only start eating once the host has said that it is time to begin. This is generally indicated when everyone says \u201cSahtain\u201d\u00a0(Good health) or \u201cBismallah\u201d\u00a0(in the name of God).\n- It is impolite to begin eating or drinking before the eldest/most senior person has started.\n- Saudi food generally does not require utensils to eat. People use their right hand, scooping with the fingers.\n- Use the right hand to serve and pass any food or dish, in accordance with Islamic custom. The left hand is considered unclean and shouldn\u2019t make direct contact with food.\n- When eating rice, it is normal to form the rice into a small ball before placing it in the mouth. If seated on the floor, rice may drop onto the plastic sheet whilst moving it from the dish to your mouth. This is normal and socially acceptable.\n- Meat is stripped from the bone with the right hand. It is polite to offer other people separate bits of stripped meat.\n- Flat bread is a staple in almost all meals.\n- When the meal is finished, guests can say \u201cDaimah\u201d,\u00a0meaning \u2018may there always be plenty of food on your table\u2019.\n- The main meal may be followed by more tea or coffee and some sweets.\n- Be aware that the time for networking and socialisation comes before the meal is eaten. Once the food has been eaten, guests generally leave very quickly after. Some Saudi men often leave very quickly after the meal is finished.\n- Thank the host directly before getting up from the table.\n\nCountry: saudi_arabia.\nPlease justify: During a dinner at her friend's house, Emily decided to serve herself some food using her left hand.

Jewish dietary laws make a distinction between kosher (appropriate) and terefah (forbidden). Some foods are inherently kosher for consumption (such as fish that have both fins and scales) or inherently terefah (such as pork). However, other foods require a prescribed method of preparation and slaughter. If this method is not followed, the food is classified as forbidden.\n- One main Jewish dietary law is the separation of meat and dairy in the same meal. As such, some of Israel\u2019s cuisine does not contain dishes with both meat and dairy mixed together.\n- Some Jewish Israeli households will have separate cooking utensils to ensure the separation of meat and dairy.\n- Some Jewish Israelis may also wait several hours after eating a meat dish before consuming dairy to avoid the mixing of meat and dairy in their stomach. The waiting time may be up to nine hours.\n- Muslim families and restaurants observe Islamic dietary rules, which categorise foods as either allowed (halal) or forbidden (haram). Generally, all food and drink is\u00a0halal except for specifically forbidden cases (such as meat that has not been prepared and slaughtered according to\u00a0halal\u00a0standards, and pork).\n- Foods that abide by Jewish dietary laws are considered halal for Muslims.\n\nCountry: israel.\nPlease justify: During a gathering at her house, Sarah decided to surprise everyone with a new recipe she learned, which mixed meat and dairy.

This is done at every meal.\n- Conversation is kept to a minimum while people are eating.\n- When guests are present, a few selected family members eat with them. Everyone else, including children, usually sits elsewhere for their meal.\n- Hosts usually indicate to guests where to sit, which is generally in the middle section of the table or mat so that they can converse with everyone with more ease.\n- Guests are served first and typically set the pace of the meal. This means that the guest should be aware that no one will begin eating until the guest does and no one will finish before the guest.\n- Take everything you plan to eat before you begin as it is traditionally seen as rude to take a second serving.\n- On Sundays and special occasions, Tongans usually cook their meals in an\u00a0umu\u00a0(a type of underground oven).\n- A popular drink during formal occasions is kava, a drink with sedative and anaesthetic properties similar to alcohol. Usually, only men are permitted to drink kava, but females (usually the eldest single daughter or niece of the family) are expected to serve the drink.\n\nCountry: tonga.\nPlease justify: During a visit to her friend's house, Emily was invited to a family dinner.

Failing to do so is seen as a sign of great disrespect.\n- If you are standing and the person you wish to speak to is sitting, you are expected to bring yourself down physically to the same level as them.\n- It is considered rude to be standing when others are sitting.\n- Generally, the only time when it is acceptable to stand in an area where a group of people are sitting is when one is serving or leaving the group.\n- Always excuse yourself if your movements obstruct the view of others. To excuse yourself, say \u201ctulou\u201d (\u201cexcuse me\u201d) and perform a small bow.\n- You would also excuse yourself in the presence of people you respect when you are sharing a story that may include offensive (but instrumental) content.\n- The top of the head is considered sacred. It is insulting to pass something over the top of someone\u2019s head or to touch or pat the head of an adult.\n- Avoid wearing any revealing clothing when walking through villages.

Commenting on someone\u2019s poor manners can be seen as overly formal.\n- Moderate swearing is common among friends and is not always considered rude.\n- Women are seen as capable individuals who can help themselves. Therefore, it is not considered wholly necessary for men to open car doors (etc.) for women. Doing so is recognised as very polite and courteous, but can also sometimes be seen as patronising depending on the circumstance.\n- When out to eat or for a drink, split bills equally by having people pay only for the food and drink they\u2019ve ordered. It is a common practice to buy \u2018rounds\u2019 of drinks while out with a group. If it is your round, you are expected to buy drinks for everyone you are with. Each individual who receives a drink will be expected to pay for at least one round.\n- Being reluctant to part with cash or share food or drink is seen as \u2018stingy\u2019 if other people have paid their share. Furthermore, asking friends to pay for you on more than one occasion is seen as \u2018scabbing\u2019 and creates a bad reputation.\n- Being overdressed for a gathering is sometimes considered more embarrassing than being underdressed.\n- \n- It is considered impolite to ask a direct question about a person\u2019s salary or wealth. Inquiring about someone's weight or age is also highly\u00a0inappropriate in many situations.\n- Spitting in public is rude.\n- If there is a line for something, always queue and wait for your turn.\n- To call over a waiter or person of service, do not wave or yell. Instead, keep an eye out for them until they make eye contact, and then nod or raise your hand. You can also gently say \u201cexcuse me\u201d as they pass by.\n- Tipping is not necessary in restaurants or places of service in Australia. People rarely leave tips or only do so if they received service that was exceedingly excellent.\n- Always say please when asking someone for help or a favour or you will come across as rude.\n- Punctuality is important in Australia, and people stick to the appointments, engagements and meetings they schedule. If someone expects they will be more than 10 minutes late, they usually text or call the person to let them know in advance. That being said, punctuality has more importance in professional settings than in social ones.

Thus, there are a number of practices one should observe when with a French counterpart.\n- You are expected to pass dishes around and to hold a dish so your neighbour can retrieve some of the meal.\n- When one begins a meal, they typically say \u201cbon app\u00e9tit\u201d\u00a0(enjoy your meal).\n- Dinner guests should not open their mouth or talk when eating, and should gently wipe their mouth after taking a drink.\n- When someone finishes their meal, the fork and knife are placed side by side on the plate on the right or in the centre of the plate.\n- At a restaurant, guests are generally not expected to share the bill.\n- There are three main meals throughout the day: le petit d\u00e9jeuner (breakfast),\u00a0le d\u00e9jeuner\u00a0(lunch) and le d\u00eener\u00a0(dinner). The largest meal of the day is dinner, and is often eaten with the family.\n- Meals comprise different courses, typically an entr\u00e9e, main, some cheese, and dessert. The French take their time eating each course of their meal.\n- Another common type of meal enjoyed is known as the \u2018ap\u00e9ro\u2019 (also known as \u2018l\u2019ap\u00e9ritif\u2019), which is a pre-dinner drink with finger foods and filled with conversations. The length of time varies from a short 30 minute meal to a 3 hour affair. If you are invited to an ap\u00e9ro, it is best to bring something gourmet (rather than a bag of chips/crisps). For example, tapenade, olives, fresh bread, or cheese would be appropriate. Additionally, the last piece of food at an ap\u00e9ro is usually left for some time until someone politely asks others if they may eat it.\n- Wine plays an important role in French cuisine. It is often served with meals, and people tend to comment on the flavours and quality of the wine they are drinking. Typically, one begins by smelling the wine, then taking a sip and tasting the flavours for a few seconds before swallowing. Practices relating to wine become more important the higher the quality of the wine. Finally, if you do not want any more wine, leave your current glass mostly full to indicate this to your host. Failing to respect wine-related etiquette is viewed as lacking manners.\n- It is generally frowned upon to leave food on a plate, particularly when in someone\u2019s home. Each course of a meal tends to take time to make. Thus, one shows appreciation for the efforts of the person cooking through the enjoyment and completion of the meal.\n\nCountry: france.\nPlease justify: During a visit to her friend's house, Emily noticed her friend leaving a small portion of the food on her plate at the end of the meal.

To be invited into someone\u2019s home is seen as a big honour.\n- An important distinction in Japanese homes is between the inside and outside. In many houses, there is a small space between the main door and the rest of the home that acts as an intermediate space. This entrance area is known as a \u2018genkan\u2019. The size of the\u00a0genkan\u00a0is usually proportionate to the size of the house; small houses will have a narrow\u00a0genkan\u00a0while larger houses will have a more spacious\u00a0genkan.\n- Traditionally, the main indoor space is slightly elevated and has separate flooring from the\u00a0genkan.\n- Importantly, the\u00a0genkan\u00a0is where people remove their shoes before entering the home. This is usually done as a way to avoid bringing dirt from outside into the house. It is extremely impolite to step foot past the\u00a0genkan\u00a0with outdoor shoes.\n- Outdoor shoes should be removed slowly, rather than kicked off the feet.\n- Once someone has removed their outdoor shoes, it is common practice to place the shoes on a provided shoe rack or to point the shoes towards the door.\n- Hosts will often provide guests with indoor slippers to wear while visiting the house.\n- Indoor slippers are usually worn all throughout the house except for spaces in some more traditional homes that have\u00a0tatami\u00a0mats (a type of flooring made of woven straw).\n- Some hosts may have separate slippers worn only when using the bathroom or toilet.\n- People nearly always bring a gift when visiting another person\u2019s home (see Gift Giving below for appropriate gifts).\n- Hosts usually indicate to guests where to sit when they enter a room.\n- The most important guest is offered the most honoured seat (kamiza), which is the seat furthest from the entrance.\n- The least important person present (usually the host) sits in the least honoured seat (shimoza), which is the seat closest to the entrance.\n- If the host does not indicate where to sit, the most appropriate choice is to sit closest to the entrance to demonstrate humility.\n- Some houses and restaurants in Japan follow the tradition of sitting around a low table. Sometimes, people will sit on the floor directly or on floor cushions. However, some places have a hole under the table where people can sit and hang their legs similar to if they were sitting on a chair.\n- When sitting on the floor, there are a couple of ways people are usually expected to sit. The formal Japanese sitting position is known as \u2018seiza\u2019.\u00a0In this position, people sit with their legs tucked under their thighs while resting their bottom on the heels and maintaining a straight back. Women usually keep their knees together, while men have their knees slightly apart.\n- In casual situations, men usually sit on the floor with their legs crossed, while women sit with both legs to one side.\n\nCountry: japan.\nPlease justify: Alice visited her friend Ben's house for the first time.

Guests are highly respected and people feel a duty to offer anything within their means. Even if a family has no food to provide a guest, they are expected to at least offer water.\n- Guests are always offered refreshments, typically tea. It is very important to accept any drink offered as a mark of friendship. Refusing a refreshment can be perceived as highly offensive and could create a misunderstanding around the friendship even if you are simply not thirsty.\n- Close friends, family and neighbours may visit one another frequently unannounced. A Somali may face some adjustment in having to arrange a time to meet.\n- Social visiting and hosting holds great importance in building and mending relations among friends and family members. Not visiting someone for a long period of time is considered a sign of the relationship\u2019s insignificance. People may also choose not to visit someone on purpose to indirectly reveal that they are angry/offended at something the person has done.\n- Be mindful that a Somali person\u2019s home is also their private place for prayer. Therefore, it is important to be clean and respectful.\n- Remove your shoes when entering someone\u2019s home unless advised otherwise.\n- Dogs are considered unclean in Somalia and are generally not allowed in areas where people pray (i.e. homes). Therefore, people rarely bring them inside their houses in Somalia and it\u2019s not common to have them as pets. Let your Somali counterpart know in advance if you have a pet dog. Do not ask them to sit in a place where your dog has just been resting. For example, it would be seen as rude for you to tell your dog to get off the couch and then offer someone to sit in its place.\n- Often an entire family will come to a household and visit at once. Men and women will usually converse separately whilst children play in an area that does not disturb adults.\n- Sometimes women will visit one another at home alone. If men want to socialise together, they often go to tea shops.\n- In Somalia, many households have two living rooms (one for each gender) where people socialise separately.\n- Visits can go on for hours. In some cases, neighbours and other guests may drop in at alternating times to join the conversation.\n- Expect goodbyes to be prolonged as people farewell everyone individually and the host walks you outside.

The more elaborate the wrapping, the better. Gifts wrapped in red and gold paper denote luck, whereas white, blue or black wrapping has sour connotations.\n- Do not give expensive gifts that are difficult to reciprocate or match.

        "instruction": "### Basic Etiquette\n- Saudis generally observe a separation between the functions of the hands. This custom is tied to Islamic principles that prescribe the left hand should be used for removal of dirt and for cleaning. It should not be used for functions such as waving, eating or passing items. Therefore, one should gesture, touch people or offer items using both hands together. Using the one hand alone can seem too informal, but if doing so, use the right.\n- Tipping is common in Saudi Arabia, but it is not routine. It is also not required if a service charge is already included in the bill. Saudis usually tip expatriate service people and individual services in hotels despite the overall service charge. For example, it is appropriate to leave $1-2USD for a porter or housekeeper.\n- Punctuality depends on the priority of the occasion. Saudi Arabians generally have a more relaxed approach to time-keeping in casual settings. People do not adhere to tight schedules and are quite tolerant of lateness when meeting with friends. However, punctuality is expected and adhered to in professional settings (see Business Culture).\n- It is considered rude to check the time whilst in conversation with someone or at a social gathering. Time spent with friends is considered time well spent.\n- Ask permission before taking anyone\u2019s photo or posting it online, especially if they are a woman.\n- Avoid sitting in any position that allows one\u2019s shoe to face another person. This is considered insulting. Similarly, it is inappropriate to cross your legs when facing someone.\n- Try to avoid situations in which you will be left alone with a member of the opposite gender (e.g. elevators, cars). If a woman is in a car alone with a male driver, she may sit in the backseat behind the driver\u2019s seat out of his view.\n- Avoid wearing tight clothes that accentuate the shape of your body or legs. Most Saudis are accustomed to seeing Western clothing. However, it is advisable to ensure your legs, arms and shoulders are covered.

When meeting or interacting with someone older or of a higher status, it is polite to lower one\u2019s head or body below theirs. Women commonly give a slight curtsy or bend at the knees, whilst men bow slightly.\n- People should address elders and those of a higher status first, using their title and surname and formal pronouns.\n- It is extremely rude to talk back to an elder or challenge their opinion, even if they are incorrect.\n- Offer guests hot water to wash their hands before giving them tea.\n- Gratitude is often shown nonverbally with claps to show respect. People clap twice to say \u201cthank you\u201d if someone is passing them something. If one hand is full, they may clap a hand on their chest instead.\n- It is respectful to pass and receive items with both hands together. If being more casual, use the right hand only.\n- When passing something of value to another person, touch the forearm of the right hand holding the object with the left hand. This is meant to give the impression of supporting the deep value (weight) of the object.\n- It is considered bad taste to wear provocative clothing. Skirts and pants should reach the knee; shoulders and midriffs should be covered.\n- If wearing a hat, take it off when talking to someone or entering indoors.\n- You can expect to be asked questions about your personal life and family when initially meeting someone. For example, they may ask whether you have a spouse and how many children you have.\n- Timekeeping is quite fluid in Zimbabwe and people are commonly late.

In accordance with Jewish customs, many Orthodox and ultra-Orthodox men wear a skullcap (kippah or\u00a0yarmulke) or a hat of some type. Some Jewish women may also wear a hat, beret, snood, scarf or wig to cover their hair.

        "instruction": "### Gift Giving\n- Gift giving (z\u014dt\u014d) is quite popular in Japan. Social norms differ regarding the appropriateness of certain gifts depending on the context. The general theme underpinning gift giving practices in Japan is that there is a reciprocal cycle of obligation and gratitude. Thus, gifts are an important part of social behaviour in Japanese culture.\n- Gifts are typically given to commemorate births, graduations, house visits, weddings and anniversaries. Traditionally, gifts were not given during Christmas or for birthdays, but this is becoming much more common in Japan.\n- There are also two popular gift giving seasons in Japan that coincide with major dates of significance. The first is\u00a0Ch\u016bgen,\u00a0which occurs around the Obon festival in July, and the second is\u00a0Seibo,\u00a0which occurs near the end of the year. Department stores in Japan often sell gifts specifically for\u00a0Ch\u016bgen\u00a0and\u00a0Seibo\u00a0that are already appropriately wrapped.\n- During\u00a0Ch\u016bgen,\u00a0people usually give gifts to their social superior. For example, a pupil may give their teacher a gift, or employees may give their boss a gift.\n- During\u00a0Seibo,\u00a0gifts are usually given as a way to express gratitude to those who are important or who have helped the individual in their life or business. It is often a way to recognise favours received throughout the year.\n- Proper etiquette is to give and receive a gift with both hands.\n- When giving a gift to an individual, it is usually done in private. Gifts given to a group are usually placed in a communal area so that everyone can share the gift.\n- People tend to wait until they are indoors to give a gift. Sometimes, flowers or plants are given outside.\n- Depending on the context, it is not uncommon for people to initially refuse the gift at first. The giver then insists the recipient takes the gift. However, refusing a gift from someone who is higher ranking is generally considered rude.\n- It is inappropriate for the giver to exaggerate or boast about the gift they are giving. Rather, people tend to de-emphasise the worth of a gift.\n- Popular gifts given in Japan include flowers, plants, edible gifts (e.g. food gift baskets, chocolate, fruits, savoury snacks), alcohol, stationery, small household items (e.g. hand towels) or clothing accessories (e.g. hats or scarves). People often appreciate gifts that are not from their current location.\n- The way a gift is presented is often considered as important as the gift itself. There are a number of customs and norms relating to how a gift should be wrapped depending on the situation. Generally, gifts are wrapped and presented nicely, no matter the gift. It is also acceptable to give gifts in a nice gift bag.\n- Monetary gifts are usually given in a decorative envelope. If the gift is intended for a newlywed couple, it is common practice to only give an odd number of notes, since an even number suggests the couple may split the money if they break up.\n- It is common to find small pre-wrapped gifts in many transit places in Japan, such as airports and train stations. These may be snacks, treats, bath products or souvenirs. Such gifts are known as \u2018omiyage\u2019\u00a0or \u2018temiyage\u2019\u00a0depending on the context. The general underlying idea is that the gift is produced from a city, town, region or country different from where the gift is given.\n- Omiyage\u00a0is often translated as \u2018souvenir\u2019 but generally refers to a local product to be given as a gift. These types of gifts are usually for travellers to bring back home to family, friends and coworkers to show thoughtfulness whilst away on travel.\n- Temiyage\u00a0refers to gifts given by visitors as a way to show appreciation. For example, when visiting someone\u2019s home in Japan, a foreign visitor will give a gift from their own country.\n- It is common for the receiver to thank the giver by writing them a letter or calling them on the phone. Depending on the occasion, it is also common for people to give a small gift in return (known as\u00a0okaeshi, a 'thank-you gift'). This type of gift is usually given after a funeral, illness, wedding or birth. The value of the gift is typically half of the value of the original gift.\n- There are several gifts that are inappropriate to give, unless the recipient specifically requests the item. It is usually inappropriate to give gifts relating to fire when visiting someone\u2019s home (such as an ashtray, heater or lighter). Sharp gifts such as scissors or knives are also inappropriate as they symbolise a wish to sever a relationship. Avoid giving lilies, lotus flowers, camellias or any white flower as these are usually associated with funerals.\n- Items that predominantly display the numbers four or nine are generally considered inappropriate (see Other Considerations). For example, it would be inappropriate to give someone four boxes of biscuits, or a comb that has nine teeth.\n\nCountry: japan.\nPlease justify: Alice attended a friend's housewarming party and brought with her a beautifully wrapped box of biscuits.

Stand up when someone older than you enters the room and offer them your seat if there are none available.\n- Men are expected to stand up to greet women\u2014especially those with children.\n- Avoid sitting in any position that allows one\u2019s shoe to face another person. This is considered insulting. Similarly, it is inappropriate to cross your legs when facing someone.\n- When someone offers you something or makes a kind gesture towards you, it is polite to lightly protest first (e.g. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have\u201d, \u201cThat\u2019s lovely, but I couldn\u2019t\u201d). Once the person insists, you may accept the offer.\n- Some Iraqis observe a separation between the functions of the hands. This custom is tied to Islamic principles that prescribe the left hand should be used for removal of dirt and for cleaning. It should not be used for functions such as waving, eating or offering items. Therefore, one should gesture, touch people, or offer items using both hands together. Using the one hand alone can seem too informal, but if doing so, use the right.\n- Be aware that if you show admiration for an item or compliment a possession, an Iraqi may feel obliged to offer the item to you as a gift. Thus, it is best to avoid making too many comments on objects that are portable and expensive in people\u2019s homes.\n- In Iraq, people say \u2018Na\u2019eeman\u2019 (meaning \u2018be blessed\u2019) after someone has just had a shower or a haircut. This is compliment is very common - similar to saying \u2018bless you\u2019 when someone sneezes. As it is a expected form of politeness, neglecting to say it may be perceived as a slight or that you are ignoring the person.\n- It is common for Iraqis to be late. Punctuality is not highly important in Iraq and unpredictable incidents can disrupt daily schedules. Events and appointments also often run overtime as people usually try to give each other as much attention and respect as possible. Therefore, It can be a good idea to allow more time for an arrangement with an Iraqi than you normally would.\n- It is expected that men pay for the women in Iraq. One\u2019s honour is often judged by their generosity as well as their ability to provide for others in Iraq. Therefore, Iraqi men may insist on paying the bill for other men as well\u2014especially in a small group or business setting. Among friends, people may protest lightly before allowing the person who volunteered to pay. However, it is considered very awkward and rude to completely refuse to let someone pay for you and pay for yourself instead.

The statement expresses gratitude for those who contributed to providing and preparing the meal.\n- It is impolite to begin eating before everyone has gathered at the table, ready to partake in the meal.\n- The most honoured guest or highest-ranked person eats first. Once they have begun, everyone is invited to begin their meal.\n- Chopsticks are the most common utensils used when eating, sometimes accompanied with a soup spoon.\n- For disposable chopsticks, it is considered rude to rub them together. This may imply to the restaurant owner that the customer views the restaurant as cheap.\n- When chopsticks are not being used, they are usually laid down in front of the person with the tips to the left.\n- It is highly inappropriate to stick chopsticks into food, especially into a bowl of rice. This practice of placing chopsticks upright in a bowl of rice is a funerary practice known as \u2018tsukitate-bashi\u2019.\n- Food is never passed directly from one person\u2019s chopsticks to another.\n- Pointing or waving at people or objects with chopsticks is considered to be impolite.\n- Chewing with one\u2019s mouth open is considered impolite.\n- When eating soup or rice, it is acceptable to lift the bowl closer to your mouth to avoid spilling food. Generally,\u00a0miso\u00a0soup (which accompanies many meals) is drunk directly from the bowl, while larger soups are usually consumed by using a soup spoon.\n- White rice is a common staple component of most Japanese meals. The rice often comes with accompaniments.\n- It is considered impolite for someone to blow their nose at the table, as well as make other loud noises such as burping or munching. The exception to this is slurping, which is socially acceptable for certain foods, especially noodle dishes such as\u00a0ramen.\n- Leaving a plate completely empty after a meal signifies to the host that you are satisfied and do not wish to be served more food.\n- It is not considered impolite to leave food on the plate when being served by others. However, when serving oneself, it is rude to over-serve and not complete the meal.\n- Once a meal is complete, a common phrase stated is\u00a0\u201cGochisousama-deshita\u201d, which is generally understood as a statement of gratitude for the effort and the expense of the meal.\n- People generally avoid eating or drinking while walking in public settings. If someone purchases a takeaway drink (especially from a vending machine), they usually drink the beverage near the machine and recycle the packaging in the nearby bin.\n- The most common alcoholic beverage in Japan is\u00a0sake,\u00a0a brewed alcohol made from fermented rice. It can be consumed either hot or cold. Other distilled spirits such as whiskey are also quite popular as well as beer.\n- Before everyone drinks their first alcoholic beverage, people usually hold up their drinks and toast with the phrase\u00a0\u201cKampai\u201d.\n- When drinking alcoholic beverages, people customarily serve each other instead of pouring their own drink.

For example, it is common to find a blend of South American and Mexican cooking styles throughout the states closer to Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico. This includes items such as chilli and burritos, and relies heavily on shredded cheese and beans.\n- Wait until everyone has been seated and served before eating. The host often indicates when it is time to begin.\n- In some religious households, families may say a blessing before beginning to eat (known as saying \u2018grace\u2019).\n- In homes, dishes are usually passed around so that each person can get a share of food. If you find you do not want one of the dishes being passed around, it is acceptable to refuse by just continuing to pass it along.\n- Ask for someone to pass a dish to you instead of reaching across the table to grab it.\n- Napkins should be placed on your lap and kept there during the meal.\n- Americans use cutlery to eat food unless eating certain fast foods.\n- Hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right hand when cutting food. After cutting a bite-sized portion, the knife is placed down and the fork is swapped to the right hand to stab or scoop the food.

This is the way food is fed to young children.\n- The pause to swap the fork between hands to cut food slows down eating and allows for more conversation over the meal.\n- Americans have a distinct set of \u2018finger-foods\u2019 which are expected to be eaten with fingers, such as pizza, tacos or burgers. They may think it is strange or unusual if you eat pizza with a fork or cut a burrito into smaller bites.\n- It is polite to offer to refill other people\u2019s drinks or pass them dishes at the table.\n- It is rude to eat with your mouth open, lick your plate, bowl or knife, talk while there is still food in your mouth, burp out loud, or lick food off your fingers.\n- It is acceptable to mop up any remaining food in your plate/bowl with bread that was served as part of the meal. This is a sign that you enjoyed the meal and is a compliment to the cook.\n- Guests may accept second servings when offered. This indicates they find the meal tasty and appreciate the hosts generosity.\n- Children will frequently be seated at a separate \u2018kids table\u2019, allowing adults to have more discreet conversations over meals. Children will sometimes be presented with a different menu selection of simpler foods and may eat at a different (usually earlier) time.\n- If children are seated at the same table as adults, they may ask to be excused from the table once they have finished eating.

If someone purchases a takeaway drink (especially from a vending machine), they usually drink the beverage near the machine and recycle the packaging in the nearby bin.\n- The most common alcoholic beverage in Japan is\u00a0sake,\u00a0a brewed alcohol made from fermented rice.

For example, southern-style cooking (often called \"American comfort food\") includes dishes such as fried chicken, collard greens and cornbread.\n- Cuisines may also differ depending on the dominant migration populations in the region. For example, it is common to find a blend of South American and Mexican cooking styles throughout the states closer to Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico. This includes items such as chilli and burritos, and relies heavily on shredded cheese and beans.\n- Wait until everyone has been seated and served before eating. The host often indicates when it is time to begin.\n- In some religious households, families may say a blessing before beginning to eat (known as saying \u2018grace\u2019).\n- In homes, dishes are usually passed around so that each person can get a share of food. If you find you do not want one of the dishes being passed around, it is acceptable to refuse by just continuing to pass it along.\n- Ask for someone to pass a dish to you instead of reaching across the table to grab it.\n- Napkins should be placed on your lap and kept there during the meal.\n- Americans use cutlery to eat food unless eating certain fast foods.\n- Hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right hand when cutting food. After cutting a bite-sized portion, the knife is placed down and the fork is swapped to the right hand to stab or scoop the food. Food is placed into the mouth with the fork tongs curving in the upward direction.\n- Note that this American norm of swapping the fork between hands differs from the European use of cutlery where the fork remains in the left hand and food is placed in the mouth with tongs facing downwards.\n- Do not cut up all the food on your plate at once. This is the way food is fed to young children.\n- The pause to swap the fork between hands to cut food slows down eating and allows for more conversation over the meal.\n- Americans have a distinct set of \u2018finger-foods\u2019 which are expected to be eaten with fingers, such as pizza, tacos or burgers. They may think it is strange or unusual if you eat pizza with a fork or cut a burrito into smaller bites.\n- It is polite to offer to refill other people\u2019s drinks or pass them dishes at the table.\n- It is rude to eat with your mouth open, lick your plate, bowl or knife, talk while there is still food in your mouth, burp out loud, or lick food off your fingers.\n- It is acceptable to mop up any remaining food in your plate/bowl with bread that was served as part of the meal. This is a sign that you enjoyed the meal and is a compliment to the cook.\n- Guests may accept second servings when offered. This indicates they find the meal tasty and appreciate the hosts generosity.\n- Children will frequently be seated at a separate \u2018kids table\u2019, allowing adults to have more discreet conversations over meals. Children will sometimes be presented with a different menu selection of simpler foods and may eat at a different (usually earlier) time.\n- If children are seated at the same table as adults, they may ask to be excused from the table once they have finished eating. This is a polite way of exiting if they do not wish to sit quietly or join in the adult conversation.\n- American restaurants tend to serve quite large portion sizes. It is acceptable to ask to have any left-over food repackaged to take home with you after eating out.\n- If eating the meal in someone\u2019s home, it is polite for guests to offer to help clear the table or wipe up dishes after the meal to reciprocate the host\u2019s generosity and show gratitude.\n\nCountry: united_states_of_america.\nPlease justify: At a dinner party at her friend's house, Emily decided to cut all her food at once before starting to eat, wanting to focus more on the conversation than her plate.

Red flowers can also have negative connotations. Some believe they cast spells. However, white flowers have positive connotations and are thought to lift spells.\n- You may give gifts out of gratitude (for example, to a host, business partner or a secretary).

It is usually used to wipe your hands before eating, and it is considered impolite to use the oshibori to wipe your face or neck.\n- Traditionally, meals begin with the statement \u201cItadakimasu\u201d, which literally means \u2018I humbly receive\u2019, but is used in a similar fashion as saying\u00a0\u2018bon appetit\u2019\u00a0or \u2018enjoy your meal\u2019. The statement expresses gratitude for those who contributed to providing and preparing the meal.\n- It is impolite to begin eating before everyone has gathered at the table, ready to partake in the meal.\n- The most honoured guest or highest-ranked person eats first. Once they have begun, everyone is invited to begin their meal.\n- Chopsticks are the most common utensils used when eating, sometimes accompanied with a soup spoon.\n- For disposable chopsticks, it is considered rude to rub them together. This may imply to the restaurant owner that the customer views the restaurant as cheap.\n- When chopsticks are not being used, they are usually laid down in front of the person with the tips to the left.\n- It is highly inappropriate to stick chopsticks into food, especially into a bowl of rice. This practice of placing chopsticks upright in a bowl of rice is a funerary practice known as \u2018tsukitate-bashi\u2019.\n- Food is never passed directly from one person\u2019s chopsticks to another.\n- Pointing or waving at people or objects with chopsticks is considered to be impolite.\n- Chewing with one\u2019s mouth open is considered impolite.\n- When eating soup or rice, it is acceptable to lift the bowl closer to your mouth to avoid spilling food. Generally,\u00a0miso\u00a0soup (which accompanies many meals) is drunk directly from the bowl, while larger soups are usually consumed by using a soup spoon.\n- White rice is a common staple component of most Japanese meals. The rice often comes with accompaniments.\n- It is considered impolite for someone to blow their nose at the table, as well as make other loud noises such as burping or munching. The exception to this is slurping, which is socially acceptable for certain foods, especially noodle dishes such as\u00a0ramen.\n- Leaving a plate completely empty after a meal signifies to the host that you are satisfied and do not wish to be served more food.\n- It is not considered impolite to leave food on the plate when being served by others. However, when serving oneself, it is rude to over-serve and not complete the meal.\n- Once a meal is complete, a common phrase stated is\u00a0\u201cGochisousama-deshita\u201d, which is generally understood as a statement of gratitude for the effort and the expense of the meal.\n- People generally avoid eating or drinking while walking in public settings. If someone purchases a takeaway drink (especially from a vending machine), they usually drink the beverage near the machine and recycle the packaging in the nearby bin.\n- The most common alcoholic beverage in Japan is\u00a0sake,\u00a0a brewed alcohol made from fermented rice. It can be consumed either hot or cold. Other distilled spirits such as whiskey are also quite popular as well as beer.\n- Before everyone drinks their first alcoholic beverage, people usually hold up their drinks and toast with the phrase\u00a0\u201cKampai\u201d.\n- When drinking alcoholic beverages, people customarily serve each other instead of pouring their own drink. Whoever you are dining with will typically periodically check your cup and refill if your drink is empty.\n- If you do not wish to be served more beverages, it is customary to leave a little in the cup to indicate to others not to refill.\n- A popular non-alcoholic beverage widely consumed in Japan is green tea. People may serve green tea as an accompaniment to a main meal, or as the basis of an afternoon tea with some sweets.\n- Tipping is not practised in Japan. There is a general belief that the prices listed for meals or services are fair, and tipping implies otherwise.\n\nCountry: japan.\nPlease justify: During a dinner at her friend\u2019s apartment, Anna and her friends gathered around the table, each with their plate served.

It is generally eaten between 2pm and 4pm. Meanwhile, dinner (la cena) is rarely eaten before 9pm. It can begin at 10pm on weekends, or even later.\n- People dine at restaurants (restaurantes or comedors)\u00a0for full meals or bars that serve \u2018tapas/pinchos\u2019\u00a0(small snacks) and \u2018raciones\u2019 (larger portions intended for sharing). Bars tend to work out to be more expensive, but have more variety.\n- Spaniards may bring additional guests with them to lunch or dinner unless you explicitly tell them that a table has been reserved for a certain number of people.\n- In Spain, people often choose their own table at a restaurant instead of waiting to be seated. At someone\u2019s home, wait until the host indicates everyone should take a seat before sitting.\n- Do not start eating until the host or person who invited everyone indicates it is time to start.\n- Keep your hands visible above the table, with your wrists resting on the edge.\n- The host gives the first toast, which is returned by the guest later in the meal.\n- In Spain, people toast by saying \u201cSalud!\u201d (Health!).\n- It is impolite to waste food. Therefore, try to eat everything on your plate. It is better to decline a large portion or second serving rather than leaving food on your plate.\n- Spaniards rarely drink tap water at restaurants. People are usually served bottled water or are expected to purchase a beverage, such as a small beer (ca\u00f1a) or wine.\n- Avoid getting too drunk at a meal. Spanish generally do not drink very heavily at meals. They tend to talk over one glass for a long time.\n- Bread is commonly served in a wicker basket on the side of meals.\n- People often use bread to eat any remaining sauces or leftovers on their plate after finishing their dish.\n- It is common to take a leisurely stroll (paseo) outdoors before or after dinner. People also sit around the table talking for a long time after the meal concludes. This is called \u2018la sobremesa\u2019.\n\nCountry: spain.\nPlease justify: At a dinner party at her friend's house, Sofia waited patiently until her friend, the host, indicated that everyone could start eating.

Commenting on someone\u2019s poor manners can be seen as overly formal.\n- Moderate swearing is common among friends and is not always considered rude.\n- Women are seen as capable individuals who can help themselves. Therefore, it is not considered wholly necessary for men to open car doors (etc.) for women. Doing so is recognised as very polite and courteous, but can also sometimes be seen as patronising depending on the circumstance.\n- When out to eat or for a drink, split bills equally by having people pay only for the food and drink they\u2019ve ordered. It is a common practice to buy \u2018rounds\u2019 of drinks while out with a group. If it is your round, you are expected to buy drinks for everyone you are with. Each individual who receives a drink will be expected to pay for at least one round.\n- Being reluctant to part with cash or share food or drink is seen as \u2018stingy\u2019 if other people have paid their share. Furthermore, asking friends to pay for you on more than one occasion is seen as \u2018scabbing\u2019 and creates a bad reputation.\n- Being overdressed for a gathering is sometimes considered more embarrassing than being underdressed.\n- \n- It is considered impolite to ask a direct question about a person\u2019s salary or wealth. Inquiring about someone's weight or age is also highly\u00a0inappropriate in many situations.\n- Spitting in public is rude.\n- If there is a line for something, always queue and wait for your turn.\n- To call over a waiter or person of service, do not wave or yell. Instead, keep an eye out for them until they make eye contact, and then nod or raise your hand. You can also gently say \u201cexcuse me\u201d as they pass by.\n- Tipping is not necessary in restaurants or places of service in Australia. People rarely leave tips or only do so if they received service that was exceedingly excellent.\n- Always say please when asking someone for help or a favour or you will come across as rude.\n- Punctuality is important in Australia, and people stick to the appointments, engagements and meetings they schedule. If someone expects they will be more than 10 minutes late, they usually text or call the person to let them know in advance. That being said, punctuality has more importance in professional settings than in social ones.

Hosts often encourage guests to have second helpings and eat more even if they are full.\n- Try to taste all dishes on offer. Not eating very much can be perceived as rude or a sign that the food tastes bad.\n- It is important to wash your hands thoroughly before and after eating.\n- Food can either be served on a large plate set on the floor or on a table.\n- If the meal is on the floor, it is set on a thin plastic sheet (1m x 1m) to protect the carpet from the food. People sit cross-legged or kneel on one knee around the sheet.

If there is no sign, it is usually mixed.\n- People only start eating once the host has said that it is time to begin. This is generally indicated when everyone says \u201cSahtain\u201d\u00a0(Good health) or \u201cBismallah\u201d\u00a0(in the name of God).\n- It is impolite to begin eating or drinking before the eldest/most senior person has started.\n- Saudi food generally does not require utensils to eat. People use their right hand, scooping with the fingers.\n- Use the right hand to serve and pass any food or dish, in accordance with Islamic custom. The left hand is considered unclean and shouldn\u2019t make direct contact with food.\n- When eating rice, it is normal to form the rice into a small ball before placing it in the mouth. If seated on the floor, rice may drop onto the plastic sheet whilst moving it from the dish to your mouth. This is normal and socially acceptable.\n- Meat is stripped from the bone with the right hand. It is polite to offer other people separate bits of stripped meat.\n- Flat bread is a staple in almost all meals.\n- When the meal is finished, guests can say \u201cDaimah\u201d,\u00a0meaning \u2018may there always be plenty of food on your table\u2019.\n- The main meal may be followed by more tea or coffee and some sweets.\n- Be aware that the time for networking and socialisation comes before the meal is eaten. Once the food has been eaten, guests generally leave very quickly after. Some Saudi men often leave very quickly after the meal is finished.\n- Thank the host directly before getting up from the table.\n\nCountry: saudi_arabia.\nPlease justify: During a dinner at a friend's house, everyone waited quietly around the table.

You will often be expected to take off your shoes before entering a person\u2019s home.

The host will usually say \u201cGuten Appetit\u201d\u00a0or \u201cMahlzeit\u201d.\n- At a dinner party in someone\u2019s home, hosts will usually always offer a second serving to their guests.

People feel a duty to offer anything else within their means. Even if a family has no food to provide a guest, they are expected to at least offer water.\n- It is very important to accept any refreshment (typically coffee/tea) as a mark of friendship. Non-acceptance would be perceived as highly offensive and could create misunderstanding even if you are simply not thirsty.\n- Social visiting and hosting has a great importance for building and mending relations among friends and family members. Not visiting someone for a long period of time is considered a sign of the relationship\u2019s insignificance. People may also choose not to visit someone on purpose to indirectly reveal that they are angry/offended at something the person has done.\n- If you are unable to visit a friend for a long period of time, make contact by phone to keep the relationship alive and make it known that you are not ignoring them.\n- Close friends, family and neighbours may visit one another frequently unannounced, especially in rural areas. However, busy schedules mean that most visits among broader friends are planned in advance.\n- Friday is the most popular day for visits, as it is a holy day of rest in Sudan.\n- Guests usually arrive at mid-morning or early evening to avoid interrupting a family meal. If you do happen to arrive during meal time, you will be asked to join them at the table. In this case, only accept a small amount of food.\n- Make sure your house is clean before inviting a Sudanese person over. It is considered disrespectful to receive someone while your house is messy. They may feel that you do not care about their opinion of you.\n- Be mindful that a Sudanese person\u2019s home is also their private place for prayer. Therefore, it is important to be clean and respectful.\n- Remove your shoes when entering someone\u2019s home unless advised otherwise.\n- Dogs are considered unclean in Sudan and are not meant to be let into areas where people pray (i.e. homes). Therefore, people rarely bring them inside their houses in Sudan and it\u2019s not common to have them as pets. Let your Sudanese counterpart know in advance if you have a pet dog. Do not ask them to sit in a place where your dog has just been resting. For example, it would be seen as rude for you to tell your dog to get off the couch and then offer someone to sit in its place.\n- Often an entire family will come to a household and visit at once. Men and women will usually converse separately whilst children play in an area that does not disturb adults.\n- In Sudan, many households have two living rooms (one for each gender) where people socialise separately.\n- The Sudanese do not sit on the floor as is customary in some neighbouring cultures.

Walking straight through the door and presenting them with the gift right away would be seen as very forward and puts an Afghan in the awkward position of having to open it in front of you. Instead, try and place it near the door as you enter or on the table as you sit down so that the receiver sees it, but can open it in their own time.\n- Do not give alcohol as a gift to a devout Muslim or any Afghan you do not have a close personal relationship with. If you know from first-hand experience that your friend drinks, you may give alcohol, but ensure that it is done covertly so their peers do not know.

Americans tend to take their guests\u2019 answers at face-value and are unlikely to be offended when a guest declines food. If you politely decline (e.g. \"No thanks, I'm not hungry\"), do not expect your host to serve you regardless, even if the family is eating a meal.\n- American households may or may not offer a small drink to guests.

It is a common practice to buy \u2018rounds\u2019 of drinks while out with a group. If it is your round, you are expected to buy drinks for everyone you are with. Each individual who receives a drink will be expected to pay for at least one round.\n- Being reluctant to part with cash or share food or drink is seen as \u2018stingy\u2019 if other people have paid their share.

Therefore, one may find that an Afghan seeks to host you quite early on in your friendship.\n- An invitation is not always needed in order to visit one\u2019s house in Afghanistan. Neighbours and friends may pay each other visits without planning them first.\n- Verbal invitations to visit someone\u2019s home may be open-ended. For instance, an Afghan may say that the person is welcome to visit without giving specifics on when that time should be. The guest is then expected to be opportunistic and visit soon. It is advisable to make it your responsibility to organise the place and time of a visit after an Afghan has expressed interest in a friendship to avoid cross-cultural miscommunications.\n- Remove your shoes at the door when visiting a home.\n- Wait to be led through the house and shown where to sit.\n- Men and women are separated in most social visits. Men socialise in one room, and women in another. The female hosts generally bring food and refreshments to the men before leaving and joining the women again.\n- You may be seated on the floor with rugs and cushions. Sit crossed-legged if you can or otherwise in a position that is comfortable for you. Avoid sitting with your legs outstretched or with the soles of your feet facing another person.\n- It is customary to be offered tea and sweets as refreshment. It is very important to accept any refreshment (typically coffee/tea) as a mark of friendship. Non-acceptance would be perceived as highly offensive and could create misunderstanding even if you are simply not thirsty. Your cup of tea will be constantly filled until you indicate you\u2019ve had enough by covering it with your hand and thanking them.\n- As a guest, expect to be offered the best of everything (the best cut of meat, best silverware, etc.). Even the poorest family will go to great lengths to make sure a guest feels welcomed and has the best treatment able to be given. Try to graciously accept everything offered. Refusing an Afghan\u2019s generosity can be awkward.\n- Dogs are considered unclean in Afghanistan and are not meant to be let into areas where people pray (i.e. homes). Therefore, people rarely bring them inside their houses and it\u2019s not common to have them as pets. Some Afghans may be uncomfortable around them or afraid of them. Let your Afghan counterpart know in advance if you have a pet dog and keep it in a separate room or outside whilst they are visiting. Do not ask them to sit in a place where your dog has just been resting. For example, it would be seen as rude for you to tell your dog to get off the couch and then offer someone to sit in its place.\n\nCountry: afghanistan.\nPlease justify: At a gathering at George's house, Sarah was offered a cup of tea by George.

Thus, there are a number of practices one should observe when with a French counterpart.\n- You are expected to pass dishes around and to hold a dish so your neighbour can retrieve some of the meal.\n- When one begins a meal, they typically say \u201cbon app\u00e9tit\u201d\u00a0(enjoy your meal).\n- Dinner guests should not open their mouth or talk when eating, and should gently wipe their mouth after taking a drink.\n- When someone finishes their meal, the fork and knife are placed side by side on the plate on the right or in the centre of the plate.\n- At a restaurant, guests are generally not expected to share the bill.\n- There are three main meals throughout the day: le petit d\u00e9jeuner (breakfast),\u00a0le d\u00e9jeuner\u00a0(lunch) and le d\u00eener\u00a0(dinner). The largest meal of the day is dinner, and is often eaten with the family.\n- Meals comprise different courses, typically an entr\u00e9e, main, some cheese, and dessert. The French take their time eating each course of their meal.\n- Another common type of meal enjoyed is known as the \u2018ap\u00e9ro\u2019 (also known as \u2018l\u2019ap\u00e9ritif\u2019), which is a pre-dinner drink with finger foods and filled with conversations. The length of time varies from a short 30 minute meal to a 3 hour affair. If you are invited to an ap\u00e9ro, it is best to bring something gourmet (rather than a bag of chips/crisps). For example, tapenade, olives, fresh bread, or cheese would be appropriate. Additionally, the last piece of food at an ap\u00e9ro is usually left for some time until someone politely asks others if they may eat it.\n- Wine plays an important role in French cuisine. It is often served with meals, and people tend to comment on the flavours and quality of the wine they are drinking. Typically, one begins by smelling the wine, then taking a sip and tasting the flavours for a few seconds before swallowing. Practices relating to wine become more important the higher the quality of the wine. Finally, if you do not want any more wine, leave your current glass mostly full to indicate this to your host. Failing to respect wine-related etiquette is viewed as lacking manners.\n- It is generally frowned upon to leave food on a plate, particularly when in someone\u2019s home. Each course of a meal tends to take time to make. Thus, one shows appreciation for the efforts of the person cooking through the enjoyment and completion of the meal.\n\nCountry: france.\nPlease justify: Sarah and her friends gathered for dinner at her house.

As a rule of thumb, gifts are typically symbolic or sentimental rather than lavish or expensive.\n- Flowers are generally not given as gifts, but rather are reserved for times of mourning or for other events such as weddings or religious festivities.\n- Avoid giving alcohol as a gift unless you are sure that the recipient drinks.\n- Black and white are colours reserved for funerals and mourning. Avoid wrapping gifts in these colours.\n- The religious affiliation of a person partially determines what gifts are considered inappropriate. For example, do not give a Muslim Sri Lankan gifts containing byproducts of alcohol or pork. Hindu Sri Lankans may take offence if given cow-related products, such as leather. In Sri Lanka, many Buddhists refrain from consuming beef.\n- Gifts are generally given and received with two hands.\n- To demonstrate graciousness, some Sri Lankans may touch their right forearm with their left hand while offering the gift with their right hand.\n- Gifts are typically not opened immediately upon receiving them.\n- It is expected that gift giving will be reciprocated.\n\nCountry: sri_lanka.\nPlease justify: During a celebration at her friend's house, Emily presented a gift to her friend Lucas using both of her hands.

Men and women may eat separately in some circumstances (e.g. if the family is highly religious or the number of people eating is too large).\n- It is important to wait for everyone to be present before starting to eat, even if the meal is casual.

It is acceptable to decline this or leave food on your plate if you simply cannot finish the meal.\n- Some people politely leave some food on their plate at the end of the meal to indicate to the host that they have provided adequately. Otherwise, if your plate is empty, your host may keep refilling it with more helpings of food.\n- As a host, try not to eat quickly and wait until everyone has eaten a fair amount before saying you\u2019re full. It is customary for everyone to stop eating and conclude the meal once the guest is full or finished.\n- After the meal has finished, a serving of tea, fruits, sweets or coffee is commonly offered. Coffee is often served at the conclusion of a meal.

New Zealanders consider most things to do with the nose to be poor etiquette (e.g. sniffing, wiping it with your hand, picking it with fingers or blowing it to clear snot onto the ground). It is particularly crude to pick at your nose in public.\n- Spitting in public places and/or in front of people is considered extremely rude.\n- It is common for New Zealanders to greet people with a brief \u2018Hello\u2019 when you walk past them. It is expected you respond with a greeting in return or a smile of acknowledgement.\n- Calling someone over by yelling \u201cOi\u201d can be interpreted as rude or even antagonising. However, younger generations may use this in an informal context with close peers.\n- Do not wave, yell or clap your hands to call over a waiter or service person. Instead, look out for them until they make eye contact, and then nod or raise your hand. You can also gently say \u201cexcuse me\u201d as they pass by.\n- While New Zealanders are quite informal, it is still good manners to say \u201cPlease\u201d when requesting something and \u201cThank you\u201d when someone does something for you. Giving a verbal \u2018Thank you\u2019 is politer than simply nodding your head or smiling.\n- Although you may hear New Zealanders swearing often, it is best to avoid swearing in public around strangers, in front of children or in professional settings.\n- Men are not expected to open doors for women. However, it is common politeness to hold a door open for someone if they are entering behind you, regardless of gender.\n- It is rude to try to skip a line if queuing for something.

Commenting on someone\u2019s poor manners can be seen as overly formal.\n- Moderate swearing is common among friends and is not always considered rude.\n- Women are seen as capable individuals who can help themselves. Therefore, it is not considered wholly necessary for men to open car doors (etc.) for women. Doing so is recognised as very polite and courteous, but can also sometimes be seen as patronising depending on the circumstance.\n- When out to eat or for a drink, split bills equally by having people pay only for the food and drink they\u2019ve ordered. It is a common practice to buy \u2018rounds\u2019 of drinks while out with a group. If it is your round, you are expected to buy drinks for everyone you are with. Each individual who receives a drink will be expected to pay for at least one round.\n- Being reluctant to part with cash or share food or drink is seen as \u2018stingy\u2019 if other people have paid their share. Furthermore, asking friends to pay for you on more than one occasion is seen as \u2018scabbing\u2019 and creates a bad reputation.\n- Being overdressed for a gathering is sometimes considered more embarrassing than being underdressed.\n- \n- It is considered impolite to ask a direct question about a person\u2019s salary or wealth. Inquiring about someone's weight or age is also highly\u00a0inappropriate in many situations.\n- Spitting in public is rude.\n- If there is a line for something, always queue and wait for your turn.\n- To call over a waiter or person of service, do not wave or yell. Instead, keep an eye out for them until they make eye contact, and then nod or raise your hand. You can also gently say \u201cexcuse me\u201d as they pass by.\n- Tipping is not necessary in restaurants or places of service in Australia. People rarely leave tips or only do so if they received service that was exceedingly excellent.\n- Always say please when asking someone for help or a favour or you will come across as rude.\n- Punctuality is important in Australia, and people stick to the appointments, engagements and meetings they schedule. If someone expects they will be more than 10 minutes late, they usually text or call the person to let them know in advance. That being said, punctuality has more importance in professional settings than in social ones.

For example, if you are coming home after travelling, they may ask if you brought them back something. Avoid perceiving this as presumptuous, rude or greedy.\n- If you are visiting Zimbabwe for the first time, you can expect that they will give you something to bring back home.\n- The most common occasions for giving gifts are births, birthdays, weddings, graduations, installations of pastors, Christmas and farewell services.\n- Gifts may be wrapped or given unwrapped. There is no strong cultural preference regarding the presentation.\n- Give and open gifts in front of everyone in attendance.\n- People commonly show gratitude by clapping, whistling, jumping or even dancing. A verbal \u201cthank you\u201d may not actually be said.\n- Food is a common gift that is appropriate to be given at all occasions.\n- Consider that Zimbabwe struggles with corruption and very expensive gifts may be interpreted as bribes.\n\nCountry: zimbabwe.\nPlease justify: During a visit to a friend's house, Sarah was greeted with a small, beautifully wrapped package.

Try to accept as many things offered as possible, even if you can\u2019t finish all of it. It is best to arrive to a meal on an empty stomach so you can accept multiple servings.\n- If you cannot eat the food, you may have to be quite insistent and give a legitimate reason (e.g. I\u2019m vegetarian). Your host may take initial refusals as politeness and serve more anyway.\n- Some Turks may not eat anything containing alcohol or pork, in accordance with Islamic custom.\n- Much Turkish food involves eating from a selection of small dishes, known as meze.\n- Turks tend to eat at quite a slow, relaxed pace.

For example, if a sister has her female friends visiting, her brother will announce \u201cYa allah!\u201d before he walks in the room.\n- Male guests are usually served by the youngest son or a male domestic worker, while female guests are served by the youngest daughter or a female maid.\n- It is customary to be offered Arabic coffee and dates upon arrival.

Once the person insists, you may accept the offer.\n- Some Iraqis observe a separation between the functions of the hands. This custom is tied to Islamic principles that prescribe the left hand should be used for removal of dirt and for cleaning. It should not be used for functions such as waving, eating or offering items. Therefore, one should gesture, touch people, or offer items using both hands together. Using the one hand alone can seem too informal, but if doing so, use the right.\n- Be aware that if you show admiration for an item or compliment a possession, an Iraqi may feel obliged to offer the item to you as a gift.

The left hand is considered \u2018unclean' since it is the hand people generally use for washing themselves.\n- An Indian may fill your plate for you, or they may expect you to serve yourself.\n- There is a general distinction between northern and southern Indian food. The latter is usually much spicier.\n- Some Indians may have dietary restrictions based on their religious faith. For example, practising Muslim Indians do not consume pork. For many Hindus, cows have sacred religious connotations, and the consumption of beef will be avoided.\n- It is common for many Indians to abstain from drinking alcohol for reasons such as religion (e.g. Islam, Buddhism) or their upbringing. Only serve or provide alcohol if you are certain that your Indian counterpart drinks it.\n\nCountry: india.\nPlease justify: During a gathering at a friend's house, Sarah noticed that everyone was eating with their hands.

People feel a duty to offer anything else within their means. Even if a family has no food to provide a guest, they are expected to at least offer water.\n- It is very important to accept any refreshment (typically coffee/tea) as a mark of friendship. Non-acceptance would be perceived as highly offensive and could create misunderstanding even if you are simply not thirsty.\n- Social visiting and hosting has a great importance for building and mending relations among friends and family members. Not visiting someone for a long period of time is considered a sign of the relationship\u2019s insignificance. People may also choose not to visit someone on purpose to indirectly reveal that they are angry/offended at something the person has done.\n- If you are unable to visit a friend for a long period of time, make contact by phone to keep the relationship alive and make it known that you are not ignoring them.\n- Close friends, family and neighbours may visit one another frequently unannounced, especially in rural areas. However, busy schedules mean that most visits among broader friends are planned in advance.\n- Friday is the most popular day for visits, as it is a holy day of rest in Sudan.\n- Guests usually arrive at mid-morning or early evening to avoid interrupting a family meal. If you do happen to arrive during meal time, you will be asked to join them at the table. In this case, only accept a small amount of food.\n- Make sure your house is clean before inviting a Sudanese person over. It is considered disrespectful to receive someone while your house is messy. They may feel that you do not care about their opinion of you.\n- Be mindful that a Sudanese person\u2019s home is also their private place for prayer. Therefore, it is important to be clean and respectful.\n- Remove your shoes when entering someone\u2019s home unless advised otherwise.\n- Dogs are considered unclean in Sudan and are not meant to be let into areas where people pray (i.e. homes). Therefore, people rarely bring them inside their houses in Sudan and it\u2019s not common to have them as pets. Let your Sudanese counterpart know in advance if you have a pet dog. Do not ask them to sit in a place where your dog has just been resting. For example, it would be seen as rude for you to tell your dog to get off the couch and then offer someone to sit in its place.\n- Often an entire family will come to a household and visit at once. Men and women will usually converse separately whilst children play in an area that does not disturb adults.\n- In Sudan, many households have two living rooms (one for each gender) where people socialise separately.\n- The Sudanese do not sit on the floor as is customary in some neighbouring cultures.

You can say that you do not want any more food, but consider that they may take initial refusals as politeness and serve more anyway. You might have to clearly insist you are full.\n- It is best to take a small initial serving so you can accept more later and show how much you enjoy the meal.\n- It is best to eat everything on your plate to show that your host provided sufficiently and you enjoyed the food.\n- Cypriot food could be described as a fusion between Greek, Lebanese and Turkish cuisines. Often, there are many components to a meal, including vegetarian dishes (i.e. dolmades) and meat-based dishes (i.e. souvlaki). People help themselves to each dish to fill their own plate.\n- Let your Cypriot counterpart know if you have a dietary requirement so that they can help you eat appropriately. Some meals may appear to be vegetarian despite containing meat. For example, lamb kibbeh can be mistaken for a falafel.\n- Though the north is predominantly Muslim, it is still common to drink alcohol at special occasions.\n- Drink any alcohol served slowly at the same pace as everyone at the table. It is frowned upon to get drunk at a meal.\n- Do not rest your elbows on the table or put your hand under your chin as if you are bored.\n- It is rude to lean back in your seat and put your hands behind your head unless in a very casual situation.

If someone is visiting unexpectedly, they may say \u201cIma li bujruma?\u201d (meaning \u201cAm I welcome?\u201d) before entering.\n- Remove your shoes before entering someone\u2019s home. It\u2019s polite to do so even if the host says that it\u2019s not necessary.\n- It\u2019s polite to always accept an offer of food and drink by a host even if you do not actually eat/drink any of it.\n- Coffee (kafa) is usually served during a visit, usually three times. The first is the greeting coffee (do\u010deku\u0161a), the second is the talking coffee (razgovoru\u0161a or brbljavu\u0161a) and the final coffee is meant to signify the time when guests are expected to leave, known as \u2018kand\u017eija\u2019 or \u2018sikteru\u0161a\u2019.\n- Hosts may provide \u2018meze\u2019\u00a0a selection of small savoury foods.\n- Visits can last for very long periods of time as there is rarely a need to rush. Expect Bosnians to happily talk over coffee or \u2018rakija\u2019\u00a0(brandy) for hours.\n- If visiting someone\u2019s home to offer your condolences or congratulations, it\u2019s normal to only stay for a short time.\n- You may be invited to stay to eat when visiting someone\u2019s home.\n- When a guest is leaving, it is important to take a moment to watch them walk away for a moment.

Therefore, try not to be offended if you are not invited to a Spaniard\u2019s house for a long time.\n- It is not essential to bring things when visiting Spaniards. People are generally more interested in your company and conversation than what gifts you bring.\n- Expect meals to be served at later times. Dinner is usually eaten between 9pm and 11:30pm.\n- Do not leave immediately after a meal is finished. It is expected that guests will stay for \u2018la sobremesa\u2019. This is the time spent after the meal that involves relaxed, fun conversations over coffee or alcoholic drinks.\n- In many cases, the sobremesa is the main point of the visit, extending far into the morning.\n- You can usually gauge when a host is ready for you to leave their home when they stop offering you more drinks.\n- People may not wish to give an outright announcement when the night is at its end. Instead, people may talk about having \u201cla penultima\u201d \u2013 one last drink for the road or \u2018the last but one\u2019. This shows a reluctance to leave because you are having such a good time.\n- Make sure you say a thorough goodbye before leaving someone\u2019s house. Everyone usually embraces before departing. Sometimes goodbyes can be quite prolonged from the time that someone actually announces his or her departure.\n\nCountry: spain.\nPlease justify: At a dinner party at her friend's house, Emily decided to stay for a long chat over drinks after dinner instead of worrying about bringing an elaborate gift.

If you empty your plate entirely, you can expect the host to take it as a hint that you need another serving.\n- It is considered bad etiquette to walk whilst eating.\n- Malay Meals: It is common practice to eat with one's hands or with a spoon and fork. Generally, pork is avoided.\n- Malaysian Chinese Meals: Common eating utensils are spoons and forks, or chopsticks. Do not leave chopsticks in the rice bowl or place them vertically.

Many visits happen unannounced or unplanned.\n- Friends are expected to visit one another to congratulate significant life events, such as the birth of a child, the arrival of a bride, a son leaving for the army or a child graduating school.\n- If you are invited to someone\u2019s home for a social occasion or it\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve visited their house, bring a small gift (i.e. flowers, coffee, biscuits or chocolates).\n- Hosts greet newcomers by saying \u201cBujrum\u201d (Welcome) when they enter the home. If someone is visiting unexpectedly, they may say \u201cIma li bujruma?\u201d (meaning \u201cAm I welcome?\u201d) before entering.\n- Remove your shoes before entering someone\u2019s home. It\u2019s polite to do so even if the host says that it\u2019s not necessary.\n- It\u2019s polite to always accept an offer of food and drink by a host even if you do not actually eat/drink any of it.\n- Coffee (kafa) is usually served during a visit, usually three times. The first is the greeting coffee (do\u010deku\u0161a), the second is the talking coffee (razgovoru\u0161a or brbljavu\u0161a) and the final coffee is meant to signify the time when guests are expected to leave, known as \u2018kand\u017eija\u2019 or \u2018sikteru\u0161a\u2019.\n- Hosts may provide \u2018meze\u2019\u00a0a selection of small savoury foods.\n- Visits can last for very long periods of time as there is rarely a need to rush. Expect Bosnians to happily talk over coffee or \u2018rakija\u2019\u00a0(brandy) for hours.\n- If visiting someone\u2019s home to offer your condolences or congratulations, it\u2019s normal to only stay for a short time.\n- You may be invited to stay to eat when visiting someone\u2019s home.\n- When a guest is leaving, it is important to take a moment to watch them walk away for a moment. Closing the door immediately after they step out of the house indicates that they were not quite welcome and the host had been waiting for them to leave.\n\nCountry: bosnia_and_herzegovina.\nPlease justify: Alex decided to surprise his friend by showing up at his house without calling first.

Stand up when someone older than you enters the room and offer them your seat if there are none available.\n- Men are expected to stand up to greet women\u2014especially those with children.\n- Avoid sitting in any position that allows one\u2019s shoe to face another person. This is considered insulting. Similarly, it is inappropriate to cross your legs when facing someone.\n- When someone offers you something or makes a kind gesture towards you, it is polite to lightly protest first (e.g. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have\u201d, \u201cThat\u2019s lovely, but I couldn\u2019t\u201d). Once the person insists, you may accept the offer.\n- Some Iraqis observe a separation between the functions of the hands. This custom is tied to Islamic principles that prescribe the left hand should be used for removal of dirt and for cleaning. It should not be used for functions such as waving, eating or offering items. Therefore, one should gesture, touch people, or offer items using both hands together. Using the one hand alone can seem too informal, but if doing so, use the right.\n- Be aware that if you show admiration for an item or compliment a possession, an Iraqi may feel obliged to offer the item to you as a gift. Thus, it is best to avoid making too many comments on objects that are portable and expensive in people\u2019s homes.\n- In Iraq, people say \u2018Na\u2019eeman\u2019 (meaning \u2018be blessed\u2019) after someone has just had a shower or a haircut. This is compliment is very common - similar to saying \u2018bless you\u2019 when someone sneezes. As it is a expected form of politeness, neglecting to say it may be perceived as a slight or that you are ignoring the person.\n- It is common for Iraqis to be late. Punctuality is not highly important in Iraq and unpredictable incidents can disrupt daily schedules. Events and appointments also often run overtime as people usually try to give each other as much attention and respect as possible. Therefore, It can be a good idea to allow more time for an arrangement with an Iraqi than you normally would.\n- It is expected that men pay for the women in Iraq. One\u2019s honour is often judged by their generosity as well as their ability to provide for others in Iraq. Therefore, Iraqi men may insist on paying the bill for other men as well\u2014especially in a small group or business setting. Among friends, people may protest lightly before allowing the person who volunteered to pay. However, it is considered very awkward and rude to completely refuse to let someone pay for you and pay for yourself instead. Some may see this as an insult to their honour.\n\nCountry: iraq.\nPlease justify: Sarah was visiting a friend's house for a casual dinner.

This is done at every meal.\n- Conversation is kept to a minimum while people are eating.\n- When guests are present, a few selected family members eat with them. Everyone else, including children, usually sits elsewhere for their meal.\n- Hosts usually indicate to guests where to sit, which is generally in the middle section of the table or mat so that they can converse with everyone with more ease.\n- Guests are served first and typically set the pace of the meal. This means that the guest should be aware that no one will begin eating until the guest does and no one will finish before the guest.\n- Take everything you plan to eat before you begin as it is traditionally seen as rude to take a second serving.\n- On Sundays and special occasions, Tongans usually cook their meals in an\u00a0umu\u00a0(a type of underground oven).\n- A popular drink during formal occasions is kava, a drink with sedative and anaesthetic properties similar to alcohol.

It is usually the largest meal of the day whilst dinner is eaten late and is a similar size to breakfast.\n- Observant Muslims will not eat food that contains traces of pork or alcohol. However, it is common for many secular Muslims to consume things that are typically prohibited by the Islamic script. For example, it is normal for some Syrian Muslims to drink alcohol.\n- Bills at restaurants and cafes are never divided. Men customarily pay for women\u2019s meals and fight over paying the bill with each other.

This should be given as a gesture to the whole family rather than a specific member. It is considered especially inappropriate for men to give individual women gifts, especially those with romantic connotations (e.g. flowers).\n- Avoid giving extravagant or expensive gifts. This can embarrass the recipient, especially if it is given in front of others.\n- When offering a gift, it is likely that the gift will not be opened in front of the giver.\n- Give and pass gifts using the right hand unless the object is too heavy and both hands are required.\n- Saudis may thoroughly examine a gift upon receiving it, remarking on it in admiration to show their appreciation and respect for the giver\u2019s selection.\n- Do not give alcohol, pork, knives, pigskin, perfumes with alcohol or anything that contains a sexualised image of women.\n- Perfume, watches and \u2018Oud\u2019 (a form of incense or oil used by Saudis daily)\u00a0are common and good personal gifts for men.

Guests are usually served first and encouraged to eat more.\n- In Poland, lunch (obiad) is often eaten between about 2 or 3pm (or even later). It is the main meal of the day and may consist of multiple courses.\n- Dinner is generally quite a light meal.\n- For religious reasons, some Polish people do not eat meat on Fridays and may replace it with fish instead.\n- When about to dine, it is polite to wait for a moment to see if someone will say a prayer of thanks prior to eating their meal. Older Catholic Poles may say \u2018grace\u2019 before a meal.\n- It is traditional Polish hospitality to offer alcohol with meals; however, it is often not drunk until someone has proposed a toast. People often toast with hard liquor to \u201cyour health\u201d (na zdrowie) and \u201cfriendship\u201d. If your host stands to toast, follow suit. If proposing a toast yourself, it is important that you make eye contact with the people at the table as you speak.\n- If you do not wish to drink, make it clear that your refusal is earnest and not just a gesture of politeness.\n- If you only give a faint refusal when offered a second or third serving of food, expect it to be ignored.\n- If at a restaurant, it is polite to tip around 10% of the bill. However, this is not obligatory.\n\nCountry: poland.\nPlease justify: At a dinner party, Daniel was eager to start eating the moment he was served, without observing the host's actions.

        "instruction": "### Visiting\n- Hospitality is central to Sudanese culture. It is considered shameful to be a bad host or give a poor welcome. People feel a duty to offer anything else within their means. Even if a family has no food to provide a guest, they are expected to at least offer water.\n- It is very important to accept any refreshment (typically coffee/tea) as a mark of friendship. Non-acceptance would be perceived as highly offensive and could create misunderstanding even if you are simply not thirsty.\n- Social visiting and hosting has a great importance for building and mending relations among friends and family members. Not visiting someone for a long period of time is considered a sign of the relationship\u2019s insignificance. People may also choose not to visit someone on purpose to indirectly reveal that they are angry/offended at something the person has done.\n- If you are unable to visit a friend for a long period of time, make contact by phone to keep the relationship alive and make it known that you are not ignoring them.\n- Close friends, family and neighbours may visit one another frequently unannounced, especially in rural areas. However, busy schedules mean that most visits among broader friends are planned in advance.\n- Friday is the most popular day for visits, as it is a holy day of rest in Sudan.\n- Guests usually arrive at mid-morning or early evening to avoid interrupting a family meal. If you do happen to arrive during meal time, you will be asked to join them at the table. In this case, only accept a small amount of food.\n- Make sure your house is clean before inviting a Sudanese person over. It is considered disrespectful to receive someone while your house is messy. They may feel that you do not care about their opinion of you.\n- Be mindful that a Sudanese person\u2019s home is also their private place for prayer. Therefore, it is important to be clean and respectful.\n- Remove your shoes when entering someone\u2019s home unless advised otherwise.\n- Dogs are considered unclean in Sudan and are not meant to be let into areas where people pray (i.e. homes). Therefore, people rarely bring them inside their houses in Sudan and it\u2019s not common to have them as pets. Let your Sudanese counterpart know in advance if you have a pet dog. Do not ask them to sit in a place where your dog has just been resting. For example, it would be seen as rude for you to tell your dog to get off the couch and then offer someone to sit in its place.\n- Often an entire family will come to a household and visit at once. Men and women will usually converse separately whilst children play in an area that does not disturb adults.\n- In Sudan, many households have two living rooms (one for each gender) where people socialise separately.\n- The Sudanese do not sit on the floor as is customary in some neighbouring cultures. They sit on chairs and couches in their living rooms.\n- When it is time for a visitor to leave, the host usually walks them out to the door or gate. Conversation can continue here for a long time before the person actually leaves.\n\nCountry: sudan.\nPlease justify: During a visit to Sarah's house, Kevin was offered a cup of tea shortly after he arrived.

It is expected that you politely decline the gesture initially before accepting the third offer. This exchange is polite as the insistence to extend the invitation shows hospitality and the initial refusal to accept shows humbleness and that one is not greedy.\n- Be sure to offer everything multiple times in return. If you only offer something once, a Somali may respond, \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay\u201d, out of modesty and politeness even though they intend to accept the second offer.\n- Be careful when you compliment an item in a Somali\u2019s house, as they may feel compelled to offer it to you as a gift. If they try to give it to you, insist that you appreciate their gesture but do not want to take it. A Somali is likely to offer the object out of politeness, and if you accept, they may end up giving you something they wished to keep.\n- There is a strong belief in the evil eye in Somalia whereby one\u2019s misfortune can be caused by another\u2019s envy (xasad) of one\u2019s possessions or success, sometimes taking the form of a curse. Do not compliment something more than once or continue to praise it once you have acknowledged it.

This is considered insulting. Similarly, it is inappropriate to cross your legs when facing someone.\n- When someone offers you something or makes a kind gesture towards you, it is polite to lightly protest first (e.g. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have\u201d, \u201cThat\u2019s lovely, but I couldn\u2019t\u201d). Once the person insists, you may accept the offer.\n- Some Iraqis observe a separation between the functions of the hands. This custom is tied to Islamic principles that prescribe the left hand should be used for removal of dirt and for cleaning. It should not be used for functions such as waving, eating or offering items. Therefore, one should gesture, touch people, or offer items using both hands together. Using the one hand alone can seem too informal, but if doing so, use the right.\n- Be aware that if you show admiration for an item or compliment a possession, an Iraqi may feel obliged to offer the item to you as a gift. Thus, it is best to avoid making too many comments on objects that are portable and expensive in people\u2019s homes.\n- In Iraq, people say \u2018Na\u2019eeman\u2019 (meaning \u2018be blessed\u2019) after someone has just had a shower or a haircut. This is compliment is very common - similar to saying \u2018bless you\u2019 when someone sneezes. As it is a expected form of politeness, neglecting to say it may be perceived as a slight or that you are ignoring the person.\n- It is common for Iraqis to be late. Punctuality is not highly important in Iraq and unpredictable incidents can disrupt daily schedules.

This practice of placing chopsticks upright in a bowl of rice is a funerary practice known as \u2018tsukitate-bashi\u2019.\n- Food is never passed directly from one person\u2019s chopsticks to another.\n- Pointing or waving at people or objects with chopsticks is considered to be impolite.\n- Chewing with one\u2019s mouth open is considered impolite.\n- When eating soup or rice, it is acceptable to lift the bowl closer to your mouth to avoid spilling food.

In Saudi Arabia, many households have two different \u2018majlis\u2019 (living room/place of sitting/private place for discussion) so men and women can socialise separately.\n- Once segregated from the men, the women of both families can unveil in front of one another.\n- Men give women notice before entering an area of the house where unrelated women are socialising to give them time to cover up. For example, if a sister has her female friends visiting, her brother will announce \u201cYa allah!\u201d before he walks in the room.\n- Male guests are usually served by the youngest son or a male domestic worker, while female guests are served by the youngest daughter or a female maid.\n- It is customary to be offered Arabic coffee and dates upon arrival.

For example, the third toast may be dedicated to love or to the women in the room.\n- A common toast is \u201cBudmo!\u201d (Let us be!).\n- Speeches are usually given in the order the host chooses or from the oldest to the youngest. The toasts tend to get longer as the night goes on.\n- It is important to be sincere during speeches. Ukrainians are earnest toast-makers and often place great importance on the speaker\u2019s words. People tend to be fatalistic, believing that good wishes are more likely to happen when spoken genuinely.\n- Drinking is a rite of passage in Ukrainian culture. It is traditional for Ukrainians to drink a strong liquor, such as vodka, brandy, whiskey or homemade \u2018samohon\u2019 (moonshine). However, today many people opt for beer or wine instead.\n- Vodka is drunk as a shot in 50 ml glasses (stopka).

However, be aware your host will likely refill your glass anyway.\n- It is often easiest to refuse alcohol on the basis of health reasons if you cannot or do not want to drink.\n- The last toast of the evening is always \u201cNa Konya!\u201d (literally translated as \u201con the horse\u201d).

Even if a family has no food to provide a guest, they are expected to at least offer water.\n- It is very important to accept any refreshment (typically coffee/tea) as a mark of friendship. Non-acceptance would be perceived as highly offensive and could create misunderstanding even if you are simply not thirsty.\n- Social visiting and hosting has a great importance for building and mending relations among friends and family members. Not visiting someone for a long period of time is considered a sign of the relationship\u2019s insignificance. People may also choose not to visit someone on purpose to indirectly reveal that they are angry/offended at something the person has done.\n- If you are unable to visit a friend for a long period of time, make contact by phone to keep the relationship alive and make it known that you are not ignoring them.\n- Close friends, family and neighbours may visit one another frequently unannounced, especially in rural areas. However, busy schedules mean that most visits among broader friends are planned in advance.\n- Friday is the most popular day for visits, as it is a holy day of rest in Sudan.\n- Guests usually arrive at mid-morning or early evening to avoid interrupting a family meal. If you do happen to arrive during meal time, you will be asked to join them at the table. In this case, only accept a small amount of food.\n- Make sure your house is clean before inviting a Sudanese person over. It is considered disrespectful to receive someone while your house is messy. They may feel that you do not care about their opinion of you.\n- Be mindful that a Sudanese person\u2019s home is also their private place for prayer. Therefore, it is important to be clean and respectful.\n- Remove your shoes when entering someone\u2019s home unless advised otherwise.\n- Dogs are considered unclean in Sudan and are not meant to be let into areas where people pray (i.e. homes). Therefore, people rarely bring them inside their houses in Sudan and it\u2019s not common to have them as pets. Let your Sudanese counterpart know in advance if you have a pet dog. Do not ask them to sit in a place where your dog has just been resting. For example, it would be seen as rude for you to tell your dog to get off the couch and then offer someone to sit in its place.\n- Often an entire family will come to a household and visit at once. Men and women will usually converse separately whilst children play in an area that does not disturb adults.\n- In Sudan, many households have two living rooms (one for each gender) where people socialise separately.\n- The Sudanese do not sit on the floor as is customary in some neighbouring cultures. They sit on chairs and couches in their living rooms.\n- When it is time for a visitor to leave, the host usually walks them out to the door or gate.

It is common for Ukrainians to arrive 15 to 30 minutes later than the agreed time.\n- If an important person or conversation takes longer than expected, Ukrainians tend to prioritise the person over the time.\n- Uphold any promises you make to see your Ukrainian counterpart sooner rather than later. Ukrainians tend to follow up on invitations to see friends and acquaintances quite quickly (often the same or following day from when it was offered). If you make a passing suggestion to meet, it will be expected this is organised in a timely fashion.\n- If you are unable to meet within a week or suggest a date in a few weeks time, Ukrainians may misinterpret this as a signal that you do not actually want to see them. Therefore, it important to clearly explain the circumstances as to why you cannot meet sooner and show earnest interest in maintaining the friendship\n- Ukrainians commonly refuse or protest things out of politeness. For example, it is the norm to decline an offer of food and wait for the person to offer it again. Therefore, if you say \u2018no\u2019 to a gesture, expect Ukrainians to persist in offering it again and again.\n- Repeat any offer multiple times to show that you are being sincere.

Ukrainians may offer their hand to help an elderly person get out of their seat, offer an arm for them to walk, and hold or open doors for them.\n- It is the norm for Ukrainian men to open doors for women and allow them to enter first. Ukrainian women may similarly expect men to perform this chivalry as a mark of politeness.\n- There is a large tipping culture in Ukraine. It is the norm to tip\u202fat least 10% after a meal.

It is also unusual to have \u2018pot-luck\u2019 meals whereby every person invited to dinner brings their own dish to share. Typically, the host will cook and prepare everything.\n- In the cities, people generally eat at the table. However, in smaller households, a food stand may be placed on the carpet that everyone then sits around on cushions. Some Turkish households may use a low table with cushions set around it.\n- Turks tend to offer food several times and prompt their guests to have more servings than they can feasibly eat. Try to accept as many things offered as possible, even if you can\u2019t finish all of it. It is best to arrive to a meal on an empty stomach so you can accept multiple servings.\n- If you cannot eat the food, you may have to be quite insistent and give a legitimate reason (e.g. I\u2019m vegetarian). Your host may take initial refusals as politeness and serve more anyway.\n- Some Turks may not eat anything containing alcohol or pork, in accordance with Islamic custom.\n- Much Turkish food involves eating from a selection of small dishes, known as meze.\n- Turks tend to eat at quite a slow, relaxed pace. It is common to stop between courses to smoke a cigarette and have a few drinks before moving on to the next dish.\n- Handle all food with your right hand. The left is associated with cleaning and should not be used to pass, offer or serve food.\n- Do not blow your nose or pick your teeth during a meal.\n- Always keep your feet hidden under the table.\n- Evening meals may be accompanied with alcohol depending on the person you are dining with.

It is usually used to wipe your hands before eating, and it is considered impolite to use the oshibori to wipe your face or neck.\n- Traditionally, meals begin with the statement \u201cItadakimasu\u201d, which literally means \u2018I humbly receive\u2019, but is used in a similar fashion as saying\u00a0\u2018bon appetit\u2019\u00a0or \u2018enjoy your meal\u2019. The statement expresses gratitude for those who contributed to providing and preparing the meal.\n- It is impolite to begin eating before everyone has gathered at the table, ready to partake in the meal.\n- The most honoured guest or highest-ranked person eats first. Once they have begun, everyone is invited to begin their meal.\n- Chopsticks are the most common utensils used when eating, sometimes accompanied with a soup spoon.\n- For disposable chopsticks, it is considered rude to rub them together. This may imply to the restaurant owner that the customer views the restaurant as cheap.\n- When chopsticks are not being used, they are usually laid down in front of the person with the tips to the left.\n- It is highly inappropriate to stick chopsticks into food, especially into a bowl of rice. This practice of placing chopsticks upright in a bowl of rice is a funerary practice known as \u2018tsukitate-bashi\u2019.\n- Food is never passed directly from one person\u2019s chopsticks to another.\n- Pointing or waving at people or objects with chopsticks is considered to be impolite.\n- Chewing with one\u2019s mouth open is considered impolite.\n- When eating soup or rice, it is acceptable to lift the bowl closer to your mouth to avoid spilling food. Generally,\u00a0miso\u00a0soup (which accompanies many meals) is drunk directly from the bowl, while larger soups are usually consumed by using a soup spoon.\n- White rice is a common staple component of most Japanese meals. The rice often comes with accompaniments.\n- It is considered impolite for someone to blow their nose at the table, as well as make other loud noises such as burping or munching. The exception to this is slurping, which is socially acceptable for certain foods, especially noodle dishes such as\u00a0ramen.\n- Leaving a plate completely empty after a meal signifies to the host that you are satisfied and do not wish to be served more food.\n- It is not considered impolite to leave food on the plate when being served by others. However, when serving oneself, it is rude to over-serve and not complete the meal.\n- Once a meal is complete, a common phrase stated is\u00a0\u201cGochisousama-deshita\u201d, which is generally understood as a statement of gratitude for the effort and the expense of the meal.\n- People generally avoid eating or drinking while walking in public settings. If someone purchases a takeaway drink (especially from a vending machine), they usually drink the beverage near the machine and recycle the packaging in the nearby bin.\n- The most common alcoholic beverage in Japan is\u00a0sake,\u00a0a brewed alcohol made from fermented rice. It can be consumed either hot or cold. Other distilled spirits such as whiskey are also quite popular as well as beer.\n- Before everyone drinks their first alcoholic beverage, people usually hold up their drinks and toast with the phrase\u00a0\u201cKampai\u201d.\n- When drinking alcoholic beverages, people customarily serve each other instead of pouring their own drink. Whoever you are dining with will typically periodically check your cup and refill if your drink is empty.\n- If you do not wish to be served more beverages, it is customary to leave a little in the cup to indicate to others not to refill.\n- A popular non-alcoholic beverage widely consumed in Japan is green tea. People may serve green tea as an accompaniment to a main meal, or as the basis of an afternoon tea with some sweets.\n- Tipping is not practised in Japan. There is a general belief that the prices listed for meals or services are fair, and tipping implies otherwise.\n\nCountry: japan.\nPlease justify: At a dinner gathering, everyone was seated and ready to eat.

However, there is a level of modesty expected in day-to-day clothing. For example, it is not appropriate to be barefoot in public.\u00a0It is advisable for women to dress modestly, ensuring their legs, arms and shoulders are covered.\n- Timekeeping is much looser than in English-speaking Western countries. For example, someone saying, \u201cI will be there soon\u201d does not necessarily mean that they are on their way. It is advisable to ask a person for a specific estimated time of arrival.\n- Many Palestinian men are raised to show chivalry, respect and honour to women by\u00a0opening doors, giving them their seat and carrying items for them.\n- If one offers an invitation to someone, it can often imply that their entire family is invited. It is good to clarify this beforehand.\n- People do not split bills in Palestinian culture. When people go out to dinner or an event, there is a general expectation that men pay for women. It is considered shameful for a woman to pay for a man.\n- If the bill is for two people of the same gender, generally the person who invited the other will pay. Otherwise, both individuals will usually compete with one another with one person conceding to let the other pay for them under the agreement that they will cover all costs during their next outing.\n- Some people may also expect those who are substantially wealthier to pay for others with more modest incomes. However, it is polite not to order expensive items or dishes when there is an understanding that you are not the person paying for them.\n- It is polite to use the right hand (or both hands together) to gesture, touch people or offer items.

However, this can also vary depending on the purpose of the visit or the level of conservatism of the family.\n- Organise your visit in advance. Americans rarely visit each other without making plans to do so.\n- Many Americans have pets (e.g. dogs and cats).

It is best to notify your host if you are running late.\n- If it is a larger social gathering or party, Americans commonly arrive roughly 30 minutes to an hour after the stated time. This is especially common if the guest doesn\u2019t know the host very personally, or does not know many of the other people attending .\n- It is generally normal for people to enter a home without taking their shoes off, unless the host specifically asks guests to take them off.\n- In American households, it is unusual for hosts to routinely offer food or snacks \u2013 unless the guest has arrived at a meal time.\n- If the host asks whether you would like food, it is expected you answer honestly. Americans tend to take their guests\u2019 answers at face-value and are unlikely to be offended when a guest declines food. If you politely decline (e.g. \"No thanks, I'm not hungry\"), do not expect your host to serve you regardless, even if the family is eating a meal.\n- American households may or may not offer a small drink to guests. Guests are often expected to make a request themselves if they want something to drink. Hosts may then direct them to where and how to get the drink themselves (e.g. \"There's soda in the fridge\" or \"There's water cups in the cupboard above left of the stove\u201d).\n- Alcohol is usually only served to close friends or on special occasions.\n- Avoid overstaying your welcome by remaining at a person's home longer than expected, unless they explicitly ask you to stay.\n\nCountry: united_states_of_america.\nPlease justify: Alice decided to surprise her friend Bob by showing up at his house unannounced with two other friends.

Chopsticks are often used with noodle dishes and in homes of people of Chinese ethnicity.\n- Guests will typically receive a second serving of food, and will be encouraged to eat as much as they can.\n- When someone has finished eating, it is common to leave a small amount of rice on the plate, or some other element of the meal. This signifies to the host that the meal was satisfying. A plate wiped clean may imply there was an insufficient amount of food.\n- After finishing a meal, utensils are placed together on the plate.\n- It is rude to transfer food from a communal plate with one\u2019s personal spoon. To get food, the serving spoon should always be used.\n- It is sometimes considered greedy to fill your plate with some of each dish at the beginning of the meal.

This is to prevent overeating.\n- If a meal contains bones, it is not considered rude to spit the bones onto one\u2019s spoon and pile them at the side of the plate.\n- In a restaurant, the host will generally pay the bill.

This is considered insulting. Similarly, it is inappropriate to cross your legs when facing someone.\n- When someone offers you something or makes a kind gesture towards you, it is polite to lightly protest first (e.g. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have\u201d, \u201cThat\u2019s lovely, but I couldn\u2019t\u201d). Once the person insists, you may accept the offer.\n- Some Iraqis observe a separation between the functions of the hands. This custom is tied to Islamic principles that prescribe the left hand should be used for removal of dirt and for cleaning. It should not be used for functions such as waving, eating or offering items. Therefore, one should gesture, touch people, or offer items using both hands together. Using the one hand alone can seem too informal, but if doing so, use the right.\n- Be aware that if you show admiration for an item or compliment a possession, an Iraqi may feel obliged to offer the item to you as a gift. Thus, it is best to avoid making too many comments on objects that are portable and expensive in people\u2019s homes.\n- In Iraq, people say \u2018Na\u2019eeman\u2019 (meaning \u2018be blessed\u2019) after someone has just had a shower or a haircut. This is compliment is very common - similar to saying \u2018bless you\u2019 when someone sneezes. As it is a expected form of politeness, neglecting to say it may be perceived as a slight or that you are ignoring the person.\n- It is common for Iraqis to be late. Punctuality is not highly important in Iraq and unpredictable incidents can disrupt daily schedules. Events and appointments also often run overtime as people usually try to give each other as much attention and respect as possible. Therefore, It can be a good idea to allow more time for an arrangement with an Iraqi than you normally would.\n- It is expected that men pay for the women in Iraq. One\u2019s honour is often judged by their generosity as well as their ability to provide for others in Iraq. Therefore, Iraqi men may insist on paying the bill for other men as well\u2014especially in a small group or business setting. Among friends, people may protest lightly before allowing the person who volunteered to pay. However, it is considered very awkward and rude to completely refuse to let someone pay for you and pay for yourself instead.

For instance, an Afghan may say that the person is welcome to visit without giving specifics on when that time should be. The guest is then expected to be opportunistic and visit soon. It is advisable to make it your responsibility to organise the place and time of a visit after an Afghan has expressed interest in a friendship to avoid cross-cultural miscommunications.\n- Remove your shoes at the door when visiting a home.\n- Wait to be led through the house and shown where to sit.\n- Men and women are separated in most social visits. Men socialise in one room, and women in another. The female hosts generally bring food and refreshments to the men before leaving and joining the women again.\n- You may be seated on the floor with rugs and cushions. Sit crossed-legged if you can or otherwise in a position that is comfortable for you. Avoid sitting with your legs outstretched or with the soles of your feet facing another person.\n- It is customary to be offered tea and sweets as refreshment. It is very important to accept any refreshment (typically coffee/tea) as a mark of friendship. Non-acceptance would be perceived as highly offensive and could create misunderstanding even if you are simply not thirsty.

Refusing an Afghan\u2019s generosity can be awkward.\n- Dogs are considered unclean in Afghanistan and are not meant to be let into areas where people pray (i.e. homes). Therefore, people rarely bring them inside their houses and it\u2019s not common to have them as pets. Some Afghans may be uncomfortable around them or afraid of them. Let your Afghan counterpart know in advance if you have a pet dog and keep it in a separate room or outside whilst they are visiting.

        "instruction": "### Basic Etiquette\n- Ukrainians generally have a relaxed approach to time. Plans are often discussed loosely in everyday conversation to accommodate for delays (e.g.\u00a0 \u201cCome around seven\u201d or \u201cLet\u2019s\u202fmeet at about five\u201d). It is common for Ukrainians to arrive 15 to 30 minutes later than the agreed time.\n- If an important person or conversation takes longer than expected, Ukrainians tend to prioritise the person over the time.\n- Uphold any promises you make to see your Ukrainian counterpart sooner rather than later. Ukrainians tend to follow up on invitations to see friends and acquaintances quite quickly (often the same or following day from when it was offered). If you make a passing suggestion to meet, it will be expected this is organised in a timely fashion.\n- If you are unable to meet within a week or suggest a date in a few weeks time, Ukrainians may misinterpret this as a signal that you do not actually want to see them. Therefore, it important to clearly explain the circumstances as to why you cannot meet sooner and show earnest interest in maintaining the friendship\n- Ukrainians commonly refuse or protest things out of politeness. For example, it is the norm to decline an offer of food and wait for the person to offer it again. Therefore, if you say \u2018no\u2019 to a gesture, expect Ukrainians to persist in offering it again and again.\n- Repeat any offer multiple times to show that you are being sincere. It is expected that you will insist your help to show the gesture is genuine.\n- Blowing one\u2019s nose in public is considered bad manners.\n- It is impolite to yawn during conversations with others, or in public without covering your mouth.\n- Throwing away food or wasting food is frowned upon, especially bread. Ukrainians tend to repurpose leftovers (e.g. by leaving them outside for stray dogs or birds to eat).\n- It is inappropriate for strangers to approach someone else\u2019s child. Close contact or friendliness is frowned upon if you do not know the child (e.g. patting the head or shoulder).\n- It is polite to offer one\u2019s seat to an elderly person, pregnant woman or children in public spaces.\n- It is respectful to assist older people using transport. Ukrainians may offer their hand to help an elderly person get out of their seat, offer an arm for them to walk, and hold or open doors for them.\n- It is the norm for Ukrainian men to open doors for women and allow them to enter first. Ukrainian women may similarly expect men to perform this chivalry as a mark of politeness.\n- There is a large tipping culture in Ukraine. It is the norm to tip\u202fat least 10% after a meal. Some restaurants may include the tip in the total bill.\n- It is uncommon to split the bill\u202fevenly in social scenarios. Typically, the person who invited people to the meal pays for the total bill or each person\u202fpays for their own order.\n\nCountry: ukraine.\nPlease justify: Alex invited his friend, Sam, to dine at his house and suggested \"around seven\" for the meeting time.

Supper is consumed at night and is usually a light meal.\n- On Friday evenings, a typical Jewish family will gather together and eat dinner. Shabbat dinner is often accompanied with religious customs, though Orthodox Jewish families may observe these customs every evening meal of the week.\n- Orthodox Jewish families tend to do a ritual blessing of the wine (kiddush) before both lunch and dinner, followed by a blessing over two loaves of bread (lechem mishneh).\n- Jewish families may say a prayer known as \u2018Birkat HaMazon\u2019\u00a0after every meal, during which people thank God for the food on the table.\n- Children usually have a midmorning snack known as \u2018aruchat esser\u2019\u00a0(ten o\u2019clock meal).\n- Mizrahi Jews or those who have migrated from Arab countries often enjoy Turkish coffee or mint tea with their meals.\n- Israelis tend to converse while eating.

When a person is about to have a meal, they usually announce it to let others gather so they can all say a blessing and eat together.\n- Table service can take a long time at Fijian restaurants. Be patient and refrain from shouting to summon people\u2019s attention. It may be a good idea to arrive before you are hungry so you do not become agitated while waiting for your meal.\n- There may be service people at luxury resorts or in the homes of elite Fijians.

If you only offer something once, a Turk may respond, \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay\u201d, out of modesty and politeness even though they meant to accept on the second offer.\n- You may have to be quite insistent if you truly want to refuse an offer or gesture.

If someone has invited you somewhere, you can make the same gesture and point to your watch to indicate you do not have time to stay.\n- It is polite to stand when someone elderly enters the room. If they do not have a seat, it is expected that they will be offered someone else\u2019s.\n- It is customary for Turkish men to escort women to a seat and to the bathroom during a meal.\n- It is considered rude/disrespectful to chew gum whilst talking to someone of a higher status or at a formal occasion.\n- Avoid sitting in any position that allows one\u2019s shoe to face another person.

Many Turks observe a separation between the functions of the hands. This custom is tied to Islamic principles that prescribe the left hand should only be used for removal of dirt and for cleaning.

People feel a duty to offer anything else within their means. Even if a family has no food to provide a guest, they are expected to at least offer water.\n- It is very important to accept any refreshment (typically coffee/tea) as a mark of friendship. Non-acceptance would be perceived as highly offensive and could create misunderstanding even if you are simply not thirsty.\n- Social visiting and hosting has a great importance for building and mending relations among friends and family members. Not visiting someone for a long period of time is considered a sign of the relationship\u2019s insignificance. People may also choose not to visit someone on purpose to indirectly reveal that they are angry/offended at something the person has done.\n- If you are unable to visit a friend for a long period of time, make contact by phone to keep the relationship alive and make it known that you are not ignoring them.\n- Close friends, family and neighbours may visit one another frequently unannounced, especially in rural areas. However, busy schedules mean that most visits among broader friends are planned in advance.\n- Friday is the most popular day for visits, as it is a holy day of rest in Sudan.\n- Guests usually arrive at mid-morning or early evening to avoid interrupting a family meal. If you do happen to arrive during meal time, you will be asked to join them at the table. In this case, only accept a small amount of food.\n- Make sure your house is clean before inviting a Sudanese person over. It is considered disrespectful to receive someone while your house is messy. They may feel that you do not care about their opinion of you.\n- Be mindful that a Sudanese person\u2019s home is also their private place for prayer. Therefore, it is important to be clean and respectful.\n- Remove your shoes when entering someone\u2019s home unless advised otherwise.\n- Dogs are considered unclean in Sudan and are not meant to be let into areas where people pray (i.e. homes). Therefore, people rarely bring them inside their houses in Sudan and it\u2019s not common to have them as pets. Let your Sudanese counterpart know in advance if you have a pet dog. Do not ask them to sit in a place where your dog has just been resting. For example, it would be seen as rude for you to tell your dog to get off the couch and then offer someone to sit in its place.\n- Often an entire family will come to a household and visit at once. Men and women will usually converse separately whilst children play in an area that does not disturb adults.\n- In Sudan, many households have two living rooms (one for each gender) where people socialise separately.\n- The Sudanese do not sit on the floor as is customary in some neighbouring cultures. They sit on chairs and couches in their living rooms.\n- When it is time for a visitor to leave, the host usually walks them out to the door or gate. Conversation can continue here for a long time before the person actually leaves.\n\nCountry: sudan.\nPlease justify: Alex visited his friend Jamie's house for the first time.

All traditional M\u0101ori tribal tattoos are deeply personal and unique to the individual\u2019s tribal group, representing important family history and/or tribal narratives.\n- The wearing of pounamu (greenstone) and/or bone necklaces is common practice among M\u0101ori. The shape of each pounamu carries important meaning.\n- It is appropriate to ask about the significance of a person\u2019s pounamu if you are interested.\n- Non-M\u0101ori may wear pounamu if they have been gifted it. To be gifted a piece signifies much about the value and respect between the giver and receiver.7\n- It is not uncommon for non-M\u0101ori New Zealanders to wear pounamu or get M\u0101ori-inspired tattoos. However, this is often for aesthetic purposes, as opposed to traditional cultural practices.\n- While it is not necessarily culturally inappropriate for non-M\u0101ori to purchase pounamu for themselves, it is generally advised against as it diminishes the cultural significance behind gifted possession.\n\nCountry: new_zealand.\nPlease justify: During a community gathering at a local center, Sarah, while conversing with Lily, playfully patted Lily on the head as a sign of affection.

It is generally eaten between 2pm and 4pm. Meanwhile, dinner (la cena) is rarely eaten before 9pm. It can begin at 10pm on weekends, or even later.\n- People dine at restaurants (restaurantes or comedors)\u00a0for full meals or bars that serve \u2018tapas/pinchos\u2019\u00a0(small snacks) and \u2018raciones\u2019 (larger portions intended for sharing). Bars tend to work out to be more expensive, but have more variety.\n- Spaniards may bring additional guests with them to lunch or dinner unless you explicitly tell them that a table has been reserved for a certain number of people.\n- In Spain, people often choose their own table at a restaurant instead of waiting to be seated. At someone\u2019s home, wait until the host indicates everyone should take a seat before sitting.\n- Do not start eating until the host or person who invited everyone indicates it is time to start.\n- Keep your hands visible above the table, with your wrists resting on the edge.\n- The host gives the first toast, which is returned by the guest later in the meal.\n- In Spain, people toast by saying \u201cSalud!\u201d (Health!).\n- It is impolite to waste food. Therefore, try to eat everything on your plate. It is better to decline a large portion or second serving rather than leaving food on your plate.\n- Spaniards rarely drink tap water at restaurants. People are usually served bottled water or are expected to purchase a beverage, such as a small beer (ca\u00f1a) or wine.\n- Avoid getting too drunk at a meal. Spanish generally do not drink very heavily at meals. They tend to talk over one glass for a long time.\n- Bread is commonly served in a wicker basket on the side of meals.\n- People often use bread to eat any remaining sauces or leftovers on their plate after finishing their dish.\n- It is common to take a leisurely stroll (paseo) outdoors before or after dinner.

Do not serve food containing pork or pork byproducts (e.g. gelatine) to your Saudi counterpart.\n- It is polite to avoid eating, drinking or smoking in front of a Muslim during the daylight hours of the fasting month of Ramadan. In Saudi Arabia, it is considered disrespectful to engage in these activities in public.\n- Saudis often prepare more food than what their guests will be able to feasibly eat. Hosts often encourage guests to have second helpings and eat more even if they are full.\n- Try to taste all dishes on offer. Not eating very much can be perceived as rude or a sign that the food tastes bad.\n- It is important to wash your hands thoroughly before and after eating.\n- Food can either be served on a large plate set on the floor or on a table.\n- If the meal is on the floor, it is set on a thin plastic sheet (1m x 1m) to protect the carpet from the food. People sit cross-legged or kneel on one knee around the sheet. Keep your feet away from the cloth or plastic sheet.\n- When seated at a table, the most honoured seating position is in the middle of the table. Guests usually sit next to the head of the family. Do not take your seat until the eldest/most senior person has sat down.\n- Older restaurants may have two sections, one for men and one for families (where women and families are seated in a separate, partitioned arrangement). Newer restaurants usually have a mixed-gender open plan, that still provide the option for families to be segregated. A sign out front will indicate whether a restaurant is segregated. If there is no sign, it is usually mixed.\n- People only start eating once the host has said that it is time to begin. This is generally indicated when everyone says \u201cSahtain\u201d\u00a0(Good health) or \u201cBismallah\u201d\u00a0(in the name of God).\n- It is impolite to begin eating or drinking before the eldest/most senior person has started.\n- Saudi food generally does not require utensils to eat. People use their right hand, scooping with the fingers.\n- Use the right hand to serve and pass any food or dish, in accordance with Islamic custom. The left hand is considered unclean and shouldn\u2019t make direct contact with food.\n- When eating rice, it is normal to form the rice into a small ball before placing it in the mouth. If seated on the floor, rice may drop onto the plastic sheet whilst moving it from the dish to your mouth.

This attitude, whilst common in the anonymous public space, differs from their attitudes of respect towards people within their own social circle.\n- When it comes to queuing etiquette, the notion of \u2018first come, first serve\u2019 does not always apply. Cutting in line may be tolerated if the person who comes later believes they are more important than others in line, or they know someone who can assist with jumping the line. For example, \u2018doutor fulano\u2019 (\u2018doctor so-and-so\u2019) may cut in front because the person serving is a patient of theirs. These intricate dynamics determine not only who is next in line, but also who generally excels in society.\n- Given large family sizes and typically small living quarters, Brazilians are generally not demanding regarding their privacy.

For example, a refusal of food implies you do not trust the person\u2019s cooking skills. It is best to accept everything offered.\n- Be careful when commenting on a Greek\u2019s possessions.

Instead, keep an eye out for them until they make eye contact, and then nod or raise your hand.

People rarely leave tips or only do so if they received service that was exceedingly excellent.\n- Always say please when asking someone for help or a favour or you will come across as rude.\n- Punctuality is important in Australia, and people stick to the appointments, engagements and meetings they schedule. If someone expects they will be more than 10 minutes late, they usually text or call the person to let them know in advance. That being said, punctuality has more importance in professional settings than in social ones. Friends will forgive tardiness so long at it is not a reoccurring pattern.\n\nCountry: australia.\nPlease justify: During a casual meeting at a friend's house, Sarah decided to wear a formal dress, thinking it would be appreciated.

Not visiting someone for a long period of time is considered a sign of the relationship\u2019s insignificance. People may also choose not to visit someone on purpose to indirectly reveal that they are angry/offended at something the person has done.\n- Be mindful that a Somali person\u2019s home is also their private place for prayer. Therefore, it is important to be clean and respectful.\n- Remove your shoes when entering someone\u2019s home unless advised otherwise.\n- Dogs are considered unclean in Somalia and are generally not allowed in areas where people pray (i.e. homes). Therefore, people rarely bring them inside their houses in Somalia and it\u2019s not common to have them as pets. Let your Somali counterpart know in advance if you have a pet dog. Do not ask them to sit in a place where your dog has just been resting. For example, it would be seen as rude for you to tell your dog to get off the couch and then offer someone to sit in its place.\n- Often an entire family will come to a household and visit at once. Men and women will usually converse separately whilst children play in an area that does not disturb adults.\n- Sometimes women will visit one another at home alone. If men want to socialise together, they often go to tea shops.\n- In Somalia, many households have two living rooms (one for each gender) where people socialise separately.\n- Visits can go on for hours. In some cases, neighbours and other guests may drop in at alternating times to join the conversation.\n- Expect goodbyes to be prolonged as people farewell everyone individually and the host walks you outside. Sometimes conversation can continue outside the guest\u2019s car for a couple of minutes.\n\nCountry: somalia.\nPlease justify: During a visit to her friend's house, Emily noticed her friend was preparing tea.

This should be given as a gesture to the whole family rather than a specific member. It is considered especially inappropriate for men to give individual women gifts, especially those with romantic connotations (e.g. flowers).\n- Avoid giving extravagant or expensive gifts.

Men should not buy perfume or Oud for a woman unless they are a very close relative.\u00a0Women may buy Oud for each other.\n- Avoid buying gold or silk clothing items for male Saudis.

It is advisable to abstain from drinking alcohol altogether if you are hosted by Saudi Arabians to avoid potential embarrassment or offence.\n- Pork is also prohibited in Islam. Do not serve food containing pork or pork byproducts (e.g. gelatine) to your Saudi counterpart.\n- It is polite to avoid eating, drinking or smoking in front of a Muslim during the daylight hours of the fasting month of Ramadan. In Saudi Arabia, it is considered disrespectful to engage in these activities in public.\n- Saudis often prepare more food than what their guests will be able to feasibly eat. Hosts often encourage guests to have second helpings and eat more even if they are full.\n- Try to taste all dishes on offer. Not eating very much can be perceived as rude or a sign that the food tastes bad.\n- It is important to wash your hands thoroughly before and after eating.\n- Food can either be served on a large plate set on the floor or on a table.\n- If the meal is on the floor, it is set on a thin plastic sheet (1m x 1m) to protect the carpet from the food. People sit cross-legged or kneel on one knee around the sheet. Keep your feet away from the cloth or plastic sheet.\n- When seated at a table, the most honoured seating position is in the middle of the table. Guests usually sit next to the head of the family. Do not take your seat until the eldest/most senior person has sat down.\n- Older restaurants may have two sections, one for men and one for families (where women and families are seated in a separate, partitioned arrangement). Newer restaurants usually have a mixed-gender open plan, that still provide the option for families to be segregated. A sign out front will indicate whether a restaurant is segregated. If there is no sign, it is usually mixed.\n- People only start eating once the host has said that it is time to begin. This is generally indicated when everyone says \u201cSahtain\u201d\u00a0(Good health) or \u201cBismallah\u201d\u00a0(in the name of God).\n- It is impolite to begin eating or drinking before the eldest/most senior person has started.\n- Saudi food generally does not require utensils to eat. People use their right hand, scooping with the fingers.\n- Use the right hand to serve and pass any food or dish, in accordance with Islamic custom. The left hand is considered unclean and shouldn\u2019t make direct contact with food.\n- When eating rice, it is normal to form the rice into a small ball before placing it in the mouth. If seated on the floor, rice may drop onto the plastic sheet whilst moving it from the dish to your mouth. This is normal and socially acceptable.\n- Meat is stripped from the bone with the right hand. It is polite to offer other people separate bits of stripped meat.\n- Flat bread is a staple in almost all meals.\n- When the meal is finished, guests can say \u201cDaimah\u201d,\u00a0meaning \u2018may there always be plenty of food on your table\u2019.\n- The main meal may be followed by more tea or coffee and some sweets.\n- Be aware that the time for networking and socialisation comes before the meal is eaten.

It refers to the quality of being thoughtful and considerate of others in such a way that the host can anticipate the needs of their guests or customers and adjust accordingly. Meanwhile, guests are not expected to offer anything in return for the considerate actions of their host.\n- Two common phrases used to indicate politeness are \u201cGomen nasai\u201d (\u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019) and \u201cSumimasen\u201d (\u2018Excuse me\u2019). It is considered proper etiquette to state these phrases when you have made a mistake or caused inconvenience. Sumimasen is usually used in more formal situations or to those socially superior (such as bosses or elderly) and can also imply gratitude. Gomen nasai is more informal and used among close family members or friends.\n- It is common in Japan for people to wear face masks, generally as a way to protect against colds. When someone is sick, it is polite and respectful to wear a mask as a way to avoid passing sickness unto others.\n- People usually walk on the left side of a path, especially in busy areas. Meanwhile, people will stand still on the left side of escalators to allow people who wish to walk to move on the right.\n- Japanese businesses often leave a small tray near the cash register for the customer to place their money. This ensures that the cashier does not need to directly come into contact with the customer. Disregarding the money tray and holding money out for the cashier to take is considered highly impolite.\n- It is considered rude to count the received change in front of a cashier. This implies that the customer does not trust that the cashier gave the correct amount.\n- Punctuality is extremely valued in Japan. Being on time for meetings, appointments, services and parties is expected. This expectation is carried through to services, such as public transport arriving exactly at the expected time.

Thus, there are a number of practices one should observe when with a French counterpart.\n- You are expected to pass dishes around and to hold a dish so your neighbour can retrieve some of the meal.\n- When one begins a meal, they typically say \u201cbon app\u00e9tit\u201d\u00a0(enjoy your meal).\n- Dinner guests should not open their mouth or talk when eating, and should gently wipe their mouth after taking a drink.\n- When someone finishes their meal, the fork and knife are placed side by side on the plate on the right or in the centre of the plate.\n- At a restaurant, guests are generally not expected to share the bill.\n- There are three main meals throughout the day: le petit d\u00e9jeuner (breakfast),\u00a0le d\u00e9jeuner\u00a0(lunch) and le d\u00eener\u00a0(dinner). The largest meal of the day is dinner, and is often eaten with the family.\n- Meals comprise different courses, typically an entr\u00e9e, main, some cheese, and dessert. The French take their time eating each course of their meal.\n- Another common type of meal enjoyed is known as the \u2018ap\u00e9ro\u2019 (also known as \u2018l\u2019ap\u00e9ritif\u2019), which is a pre-dinner drink with finger foods and filled with conversations. The length of time varies from a short 30 minute meal to a 3 hour affair. If you are invited to an ap\u00e9ro, it is best to bring something gourmet (rather than a bag of chips/crisps). For example, tapenade, olives, fresh bread, or cheese would be appropriate. Additionally, the last piece of food at an ap\u00e9ro is usually left for some time until someone politely asks others if they may eat it.\n- Wine plays an important role in French cuisine. It is often served with meals, and people tend to comment on the flavours and quality of the wine they are drinking. Typically, one begins by smelling the wine, then taking a sip and tasting the flavours for a few seconds before swallowing. Practices relating to wine become more important the higher the quality of the wine. Finally, if you do not want any more wine, leave your current glass mostly full to indicate this to your host. Failing to respect wine-related etiquette is viewed as lacking manners.\n- It is generally frowned upon to leave food on a plate, particularly when in someone\u2019s home.

For example, it is common to find a blend of South American and Mexican cooking styles throughout the states closer to Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico. This includes items such as chilli and burritos, and relies heavily on shredded cheese and beans.\n- Wait until everyone has been seated and served before eating. The host often indicates when it is time to begin.\n- In some religious households, families may say a blessing before beginning to eat (known as saying \u2018grace\u2019).\n- In homes, dishes are usually passed around so that each person can get a share of food. If you find you do not want one of the dishes being passed around, it is acceptable to refuse by just continuing to pass it along.\n- Ask for someone to pass a dish to you instead of reaching across the table to grab it.\n- Napkins should be placed on your lap and kept there during the meal.\n- Americans use cutlery to eat food unless eating certain fast foods.\n- Hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right hand when cutting food. After cutting a bite-sized portion, the knife is placed down and the fork is swapped to the right hand to stab or scoop the food. Food is placed into the mouth with the fork tongs curving in the upward direction.\n- Note that this American norm of swapping the fork between hands differs from the European use of cutlery where the fork remains in the left hand and food is placed in the mouth with tongs facing downwards.\n- Do not cut up all the food on your plate at once. This is the way food is fed to young children.\n- The pause to swap the fork between hands to cut food slows down eating and allows for more conversation over the meal.\n- Americans have a distinct set of \u2018finger-foods\u2019 which are expected to be eaten with fingers, such as pizza, tacos or burgers. They may think it is strange or unusual if you eat pizza with a fork or cut a burrito into smaller bites.\n- It is polite to offer to refill other people\u2019s drinks or pass them dishes at the table.\n- It is rude to eat with your mouth open, lick your plate, bowl or knife, talk while there is still food in your mouth, burp out loud, or lick food off your fingers.\n- It is acceptable to mop up any remaining food in your plate/bowl with bread that was served as part of the meal. This is a sign that you enjoyed the meal and is a compliment to the cook.\n- Guests may accept second servings when offered. This indicates they find the meal tasty and appreciate the hosts generosity.\n- Children will frequently be seated at a separate \u2018kids table\u2019, allowing adults to have more discreet conversations over meals. Children will sometimes be presented with a different menu selection of simpler foods and may eat at a different (usually earlier) time.\n- If children are seated at the same table as adults, they may ask to be excused from the table once they have finished eating. This is a polite way of exiting if they do not wish to sit quietly or join in the adult conversation.\n- American restaurants tend to serve quite large portion sizes. It is acceptable to ask to have any left-over food repackaged to take home with you after eating out.\n- If eating the meal in someone\u2019s home, it is polite for guests to offer to help clear the table or wipe up dishes after the meal to reciprocate the host\u2019s generosity and show gratitude.\n\nCountry: united_states_of_america.\nPlease justify: During a dinner party at her friend's house, Sarah immediately started eating once her plate was served, without waiting for others.

This custom is tied to Islamic principles that prescribe the left hand should be used for removal of dirt and for cleaning. It should not be used for functions such as waving, eating or passing items. Therefore, one should gesture, touch people or offer items using both hands together. Using the one hand alone can seem too informal, but if doing so, use the right.\n- Tipping is common in Saudi Arabia, but it is not routine. It is also not required if a service charge is already included in the bill. Saudis usually tip expatriate service people and individual services in hotels despite the overall service charge. For example, it is appropriate to leave $1-2USD for a porter or housekeeper.\n- Punctuality depends on the priority of the occasion. Saudi Arabians generally have a more relaxed approach to time-keeping in casual settings. People do not adhere to tight schedules and are quite tolerant of lateness when meeting with friends. However, punctuality is expected and adhered to in professional settings (see Business Culture).\n- It is considered rude to check the time whilst in conversation with someone or at a social gathering.

This is considered insulting. Similarly, it is inappropriate to cross your legs when facing someone.\n- Try to avoid situations in which you will be left alone with a member of the opposite gender (e.g. elevators, cars). If a woman is in a car alone with a male driver, she may sit in the backseat behind the driver\u2019s seat out of his view.\n- Avoid wearing tight clothes that accentuate the shape of your body or legs. Most Saudis are accustomed to seeing Western clothing. However, it is advisable to ensure your legs, arms and shoulders are covered. Women are recommended to wear a\u00a0hair/head scarf covering\u00a0if visiting Saudi Arabia.\n- Pay respect to elderly in all situations.

        "instruction": "### Basic Etiquette\n- An important concept that informs etiquette in Japan is omotenashi, which generally translates as \u2018hospitality\u2019. It refers to the quality of being thoughtful and considerate of others in such a way that the host can anticipate the needs of their guests or customers and adjust accordingly. Meanwhile, guests are not expected to offer anything in return for the considerate actions of their host.\n- Two common phrases used to indicate politeness are \u201cGomen nasai\u201d (\u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019) and \u201cSumimasen\u201d (\u2018Excuse me\u2019). It is considered proper etiquette to state these phrases when you have made a mistake or caused inconvenience. Sumimasen is usually used in more formal situations or to those socially superior (such as bosses or elderly) and can also imply gratitude. Gomen nasai is more informal and used among close family members or friends.\n- It is common in Japan for people to wear face masks, generally as a way to protect against colds. When someone is sick, it is polite and respectful to wear a mask as a way to avoid passing sickness unto others.\n- People usually walk on the left side of a path, especially in busy areas. Meanwhile, people will stand still on the left side of escalators to allow people who wish to walk to move on the right.\n- Japanese businesses often leave a small tray near the cash register for the customer to place their money. This ensures that the cashier does not need to directly come into contact with the customer. Disregarding the money tray and holding money out for the cashier to take is considered highly impolite.\n- It is considered rude to count the received change in front of a cashier. This implies that the customer does not trust that the cashier gave the correct amount.\n- Punctuality is extremely valued in Japan. Being on time for meetings, appointments, services and parties is expected. This expectation is carried through to services, such as public transport arriving exactly at the expected time. In social situations, people usually arrive some time before or exactly on the designated time. If you expect a delay, politely inform your Japanese counterpart.\n\nCountry: japan.\nPlease justify: Alice went to buy a book at a local store.

This is done at every meal.\n- Conversation is kept to a minimum while people are eating.\n- When guests are present, a few selected family members eat with them. Everyone else, including children, usually sits elsewhere for their meal.\n- Hosts usually indicate to guests where to sit, which is generally in the middle section of the table or mat so that they can converse with everyone with more ease.\n- Guests are served first and typically set the pace of the meal. This means that the guest should be aware that no one will begin eating until the guest does and no one will finish before the guest.\n- Take everything you plan to eat before you begin as it is traditionally seen as rude to take a second serving.\n- On Sundays and special occasions, Tongans usually cook their meals in an\u00a0umu\u00a0(a type of underground oven).\n- A popular drink during formal occasions is kava, a drink with sedative and anaesthetic properties similar to alcohol.

        "instruction": "### Gift Giving\n- Gift giving (z\u014dt\u014d) is quite popular in Japan. Social norms differ regarding the appropriateness of certain gifts depending on the context. The general theme underpinning gift giving practices in Japan is that there is a reciprocal cycle of obligation and gratitude. Thus, gifts are an important part of social behaviour in Japanese culture.\n- Gifts are typically given to commemorate births, graduations, house visits, weddings and anniversaries. Traditionally, gifts were not given during Christmas or for birthdays, but this is becoming much more common in Japan.\n- There are also two popular gift giving seasons in Japan that coincide with major dates of significance. The first is\u00a0Ch\u016bgen,\u00a0which occurs around the Obon festival in July, and the second is\u00a0Seibo,\u00a0which occurs near the end of the year. Department stores in Japan often sell gifts specifically for\u00a0Ch\u016bgen\u00a0and\u00a0Seibo\u00a0that are already appropriately wrapped.\n- During\u00a0Ch\u016bgen,\u00a0people usually give gifts to their social superior. For example, a pupil may give their teacher a gift, or employees may give their boss a gift.\n- During\u00a0Seibo,\u00a0gifts are usually given as a way to express gratitude to those who are important or who have helped the individual in their life or business. It is often a way to recognise favours received throughout the year.\n- Proper etiquette is to give and receive a gift with both hands.\n- When giving a gift to an individual, it is usually done in private. Gifts given to a group are usually placed in a communal area so that everyone can share the gift.\n- People tend to wait until they are indoors to give a gift. Sometimes, flowers or plants are given outside.\n- Depending on the context, it is not uncommon for people to initially refuse the gift at first. The giver then insists the recipient takes the gift. However, refusing a gift from someone who is higher ranking is generally considered rude.\n- It is inappropriate for the giver to exaggerate or boast about the gift they are giving. Rather, people tend to de-emphasise the worth of a gift.\n- Popular gifts given in Japan include flowers, plants, edible gifts (e.g. food gift baskets, chocolate, fruits, savoury snacks), alcohol, stationery, small household items (e.g. hand towels) or clothing accessories (e.g. hats or scarves). People often appreciate gifts that are not from their current location.\n- The way a gift is presented is often considered as important as the gift itself. There are a number of customs and norms relating to how a gift should be wrapped depending on the situation. Generally, gifts are wrapped and presented nicely, no matter the gift. It is also acceptable to give gifts in a nice gift bag.\n- Monetary gifts are usually given in a decorative envelope. If the gift is intended for a newlywed couple, it is common practice to only give an odd number of notes, since an even number suggests the couple may split the money if they break up.\n- It is common to find small pre-wrapped gifts in many transit places in Japan, such as airports and train stations. These may be snacks, treats, bath products or souvenirs. Such gifts are known as \u2018omiyage\u2019\u00a0or \u2018temiyage\u2019\u00a0depending on the context. The general underlying idea is that the gift is produced from a city, town, region or country different from where the gift is given.\n- Omiyage\u00a0is often translated as \u2018souvenir\u2019 but generally refers to a local product to be given as a gift. These types of gifts are usually for travellers to bring back home to family, friends and coworkers to show thoughtfulness whilst away on travel.\n- Temiyage\u00a0refers to gifts given by visitors as a way to show appreciation. For example, when visiting someone\u2019s home in Japan, a foreign visitor will give a gift from their own country.\n- It is common for the receiver to thank the giver by writing them a letter or calling them on the phone. Depending on the occasion, it is also common for people to give a small gift in return (known as\u00a0okaeshi, a 'thank-you gift'). This type of gift is usually given after a funeral, illness, wedding or birth. The value of the gift is typically half of the value of the original gift.\n- There are several gifts that are inappropriate to give, unless the recipient specifically requests the item. It is usually inappropriate to give gifts relating to fire when visiting someone\u2019s home (such as an ashtray, heater or lighter). Sharp gifts such as scissors or knives are also inappropriate as they symbolise a wish to sever a relationship. Avoid giving lilies, lotus flowers, camellias or any white flower as these are usually associated with funerals.\n- Items that predominantly display the numbers four or nine are generally considered inappropriate (see Other Considerations). For example, it would be inappropriate to give someone four boxes of biscuits, or a comb that has nine teeth.\n\nCountry: japan.\nPlease justify: Chris went to visit his friend Alex at his home and brought a gift to express his gratitude for the invitation.

People feel a duty to offer anything else within their means. Even if a family has no food to provide a guest, they are expected to at least offer water.\n- It is very important to accept any refreshment (typically coffee/tea) as a mark of friendship. Non-acceptance would be perceived as highly offensive and could create misunderstanding even if you are simply not thirsty.\n- Social visiting and hosting has a great importance for building and mending relations among friends and family members. Not visiting someone for a long period of time is considered a sign of the relationship\u2019s insignificance. People may also choose not to visit someone on purpose to indirectly reveal that they are angry/offended at something the person has done.\n- If you are unable to visit a friend for a long period of time, make contact by phone to keep the relationship alive and make it known that you are not ignoring them.\n- Close friends, family and neighbours may visit one another frequently unannounced, especially in rural areas. However, busy schedules mean that most visits among broader friends are planned in advance.\n- Friday is the most popular day for visits, as it is a holy day of rest in Sudan.\n- Guests usually arrive at mid-morning or early evening to avoid interrupting a family meal. If you do happen to arrive during meal time, you will be asked to join them at the table. In this case, only accept a small amount of food.\n- Make sure your house is clean before inviting a Sudanese person over. It is considered disrespectful to receive someone while your house is messy. They may feel that you do not care about their opinion of you.\n- Be mindful that a Sudanese person\u2019s home is also their private place for prayer. Therefore, it is important to be clean and respectful.\n- Remove your shoes when entering someone\u2019s home unless advised otherwise.\n- Dogs are considered unclean in Sudan and are not meant to be let into areas where people pray (i.e. homes). Therefore, people rarely bring them inside their houses in Sudan and it\u2019s not common to have them as pets. Let your Sudanese counterpart know in advance if you have a pet dog. Do not ask them to sit in a place where your dog has just been resting. For example, it would be seen as rude for you to tell your dog to get off the couch and then offer someone to sit in its place.\n- Often an entire family will come to a household and visit at once. Men and women will usually converse separately whilst children play in an area that does not disturb adults.\n- In Sudan, many households have two living rooms (one for each gender) where people socialise separately.\n- The Sudanese do not sit on the floor as is customary in some neighbouring cultures. They sit on chairs and couches in their living rooms.\n- When it is time for a visitor to leave, the host usually walks them out to the door or gate. Conversation can continue here for a long time before the person actually leaves.\n\nCountry: sudan.\nPlease justify: Sarah was invited to her colleague's house for the first time.

The left hand is used for cleaning and hygiene purposes and should not be used to gesture or touch things (e.g. food/people). See more under Non-Verbal in Communication.\n- Wear clothes that cover your shoulders and knees to respect the modesty of your Sudanese counterpart.\u00a0Women especially are expected to be modest in their behaviour and dress when in public.\n- It is very inappropriate to openly flirt with a Sudanese girl or woman if you are a man.\n- Sudanese men may find it particularly dishonourable and disrespectful for other men to enquire about their female family members specifically, unless you know the family or person well.\n- Lateness does not imply rudeness or disrespect and is common among friends. Sudanese people tend to be extremely patient and have a more relaxed approach to timekeeping.\n- When something does not happen according to plan due to one\u2019s error, one can say \u201cMalesh\u201d (Sorry). This offers regret whilst saving one\u2019s reputation at the same time.\n- Do not walk in front of someone or interrupt them whilst they are in prayer.\n- Avoid eating, drinking or smoking in front of a Muslim during the fasting month of Ramadan.\n- It is rude to show, point or expose the soles of feet your feet to another person whilst sitting.\n\nCountry: sudan.\nPlease justify: At a friend's house, Alex noticed his friend was late to their meeting.

This exchange is polite as the insistence to extend the invitation shows hospitality and the initial refusal to accept shows humbleness and that one is not greedy.\n- Consider that Ethiopians may refuse your offer initially out of politeness. Therefore, try and offer gestures more than once to give them the opportunity to accept something on the second or third attempt.\n- Strict punctuality is not expected in casual settings, but considerable lateness is also unacceptable.\n- It is considered inappropriate to ask to split a bill.

However, personal gifts are usually only given by close friends.\n- It is polite to bring a small gift as a gesture of thanks if invited to a Saudi\u2019s family home (e.g. food items). This should be given as a gesture to the whole family rather than a specific member.

This can embarrass the recipient, especially if it is given in front of others.\n- When offering a gift, it is likely that the gift will not be opened in front of the giver.\n- Give and pass gifts using the right hand unless the object is too heavy and both hands are required.\n- Saudis may thoroughly examine a gift upon receiving it, remarking on it in admiration to show their appreciation and respect for the giver\u2019s selection.\n- Do not give alcohol, pork, knives, pigskin, perfumes with alcohol or anything that contains a sexualised image of women.\n- Perfume, watches and \u2018Oud\u2019 (a form of incense or oil used by Saudis daily)\u00a0are common and good personal gifts for men. Men should not buy perfume or Oud for a woman unless they are a very close relative.\u00a0Women may buy Oud for each other.\n- Avoid buying gold or silk clothing items for male Saudis. Wearing these materials goes against Islamic custom.

Thus, there are a number of practices one should observe when with a French counterpart.\n- You are expected to pass dishes around and to hold a dish so your neighbour can retrieve some of the meal.\n- When one begins a meal, they typically say \u201cbon app\u00e9tit\u201d\u00a0(enjoy your meal).\n- Dinner guests should not open their mouth or talk when eating, and should gently wipe their mouth after taking a drink.\n- When someone finishes their meal, the fork and knife are placed side by side on the plate on the right or in the centre of the plate.\n- At a restaurant, guests are generally not expected to share the bill.\n- There are three main meals throughout the day: le petit d\u00e9jeuner (breakfast),\u00a0le d\u00e9jeuner\u00a0(lunch) and le d\u00eener\u00a0(dinner). The largest meal of the day is dinner, and is often eaten with the family.\n- Meals comprise different courses, typically an entr\u00e9e, main, some cheese, and dessert. The French take their time eating each course of their meal.\n- Another common type of meal enjoyed is known as the \u2018ap\u00e9ro\u2019 (also known as \u2018l\u2019ap\u00e9ritif\u2019), which is a pre-dinner drink with finger foods and filled with conversations. The length of time varies from a short 30 minute meal to a 3 hour affair. If you are invited to an ap\u00e9ro, it is best to bring something gourmet (rather than a bag of chips/crisps). For example, tapenade, olives, fresh bread, or cheese would be appropriate. Additionally, the last piece of food at an ap\u00e9ro is usually left for some time until someone politely asks others if they may eat it.\n- Wine plays an important role in French cuisine. It is often served with meals, and people tend to comment on the flavours and quality of the wine they are drinking. Typically, one begins by smelling the wine, then taking a sip and tasting the flavours for a few seconds before swallowing. Practices relating to wine become more important the higher the quality of the wine. Finally, if you do not want any more wine, leave your current glass mostly full to indicate this to your host. Failing to respect wine-related etiquette is viewed as lacking manners.\n- It is generally frowned upon to leave food on a plate, particularly when in someone\u2019s home. Each course of a meal tends to take time to make. Thus, one shows appreciation for the efforts of the person cooking through the enjoyment and completion of the meal.\n\nCountry: france.\nPlease justify: At dinner at Lily's house, Michael savored each course slowly, and made sure to finish all the food on his plate, expressing his appreciation for Lily's cooking.

Similarly, pillows that are used for seating or to prop legs, arms, etc. should not be then moved under the head.

People are generally more interested in your company and conversation than what gifts you bring. However, it is common for female guests to bring a salad or dessert to a dinner while male guests usually bring alcohol.\n- Mexicans have a reputation for being hospitable. They generally wish for their guests to sit back and relax whilst they accommodate for the visit. However, it is polite to ask to assist the host to cook and clean up.\n- It is considered very impolite to refuse refreshments outright. If you are offered something by your host, you can politely decline the offer by saying \u201cahorita\u201d (literally translating as \u201cright now\u201d). This means \u2018not right now, but maybe later\u2019 and is a far more polite way to refuse an item.\n- Do not leave directly after a meal has been served. It is expected that guests will stay to converse for a while after.\n- Make sure you say a thorough goodbye before leaving someone\u2019s house. Everyone usually embraces before departing. Sometimes goodbyes can be quite prolonged from the time that someone actually announces his or her departure.\n- It is important to call or text your Mexican counterpart when you get home to let them know that you arrived safely.

If they try to give it to you, insist that you appreciate their gesture but do not want to take it. A Sudanese person is likely to offer the object out of politeness, and if you accept, they may end up giving you something they wished to keep.\n- There is a strong belief in the evil eye in Sudan\u00a0whereby one\u2019s misfortune is caused by another\u2019s envy, sometimes taking the form of a curse.\u00a0Do not compliment something more than once or continue to praise it once you have acknowledged it.

Even if a family has no food to provide a guest, they are expected to at least offer water.\n- Guests are always offered refreshments, typically tea. It is very important to accept any drink offered as a mark of friendship.

Not visiting someone for a long period of time is considered a sign of the relationship\u2019s insignificance. People may also choose not to visit someone on purpose to indirectly reveal that they are angry/offended at something the person has done.\n- Be mindful that a Somali person\u2019s home is also their private place for prayer.

Men and women will usually converse separately whilst children play in an area that does not disturb adults.\n- Sometimes women will visit one another at home alone. If men want to socialise together, they often go to tea shops.\n- In Somalia, many households have two living rooms (one for each gender) where people socialise separately.\n- Visits can go on for hours.

For example, if a sister has her female friends visiting, her brother will announce \u201cYa allah!\u201d before he walks in the room.\n- Male guests are usually served by the youngest son or a male domestic worker, while female guests are served by the youngest daughter or a female maid.\n- It is customary to be offered Arabic coffee and dates upon arrival. Coffee is often served in a \u2018finjan\u2019 (small cup).\n- It is good to accept any drink offered as a mark of friendship. Refusing a refreshment could create a misunderstanding around the friendship even if you are simply not thirsty.\n- Coffee is followed by a sweet of some kind, usually a mint and/or ginger tea.\n- Hosts will continue to refill guest\u2019s cups until the guest indicates they\u2019ve had enough by covering the mouth of the cup with their hand or gently shaking the cup from side to side and saying \u201cBas\u201d (Enough).\n- It is improper/unclean for people to drink out of the same cup.\n- Hosts may light \u2018Oud\u2019 or agawood (a form of incense or oil) during a guest\u2019s visit.\n\nCountry: saudi_arabia.\nPlease justify: During a visit to his friend Ali's house, Michael was offered Arabic coffee and dates upon arrival.

Thus, there are a number of practices one should observe when with a French counterpart.\n- You are expected to pass dishes around and to hold a dish so your neighbour can retrieve some of the meal.\n- When one begins a meal, they typically say \u201cbon app\u00e9tit\u201d\u00a0(enjoy your meal).\n- Dinner guests should not open their mouth or talk when eating, and should gently wipe their mouth after taking a drink.\n- When someone finishes their meal, the fork and knife are placed side by side on the plate on the right or in the centre of the plate.\n- At a restaurant, guests are generally not expected to share the bill.\n- There are three main meals throughout the day: le petit d\u00e9jeuner (breakfast),\u00a0le d\u00e9jeuner\u00a0(lunch) and le d\u00eener\u00a0(dinner). The largest meal of the day is dinner, and is often eaten with the family.\n- Meals comprise different courses, typically an entr\u00e9e, main, some cheese, and dessert. The French take their time eating each course of their meal.\n- Another common type of meal enjoyed is known as the \u2018ap\u00e9ro\u2019 (also known as \u2018l\u2019ap\u00e9ritif\u2019), which is a pre-dinner drink with finger foods and filled with conversations. The length of time varies from a short 30 minute meal to a 3 hour affair. If you are invited to an ap\u00e9ro, it is best to bring something gourmet (rather than a bag of chips/crisps). For example, tapenade, olives, fresh bread, or cheese would be appropriate. Additionally, the last piece of food at an ap\u00e9ro is usually left for some time until someone politely asks others if they may eat it.\n- Wine plays an important role in French cuisine. It is often served with meals, and people tend to comment on the flavours and quality of the wine they are drinking. Typically, one begins by smelling the wine, then taking a sip and tasting the flavours for a few seconds before swallowing. Practices relating to wine become more important the higher the quality of the wine. Finally, if you do not want any more wine, leave your current glass mostly full to indicate this to your host. Failing to respect wine-related etiquette is viewed as lacking manners.\n- It is generally frowned upon to leave food on a plate, particularly when in someone\u2019s home. Each course of a meal tends to take time to make. Thus, one shows appreciation for the efforts of the person cooking through the enjoyment and completion of the meal.\n\nCountry: france.\nPlease justify: At a dinner party at Sarah's house, Kevin was served a dish he wasn't particularly fond of.

Arriving to an event substantially later than the start time is acceptable, though this depends upon the context of the event.\n- With new acquaintances, it is not expected to offer to bring something for a meal.

If it is a simple home, acknowledge their d\u00e9cor and contents.\n- When visiting a home with children, make an effort to engage with them no matter how young they are. Not doing so displays disinterest in your host and is considered arrogant behaviour.\n- At social events hosted by conservative families, men and women will socialise and eat separately.

Delays and lateness tend to reflect badly on people, often interpreted as disrespectful or rude. However, lateness can be acceptable in some contexts (for example, when attending large parties or social gatherings).\n- It is rude to push in line or skip people in a line.

For example, southern-style cooking (often called \"American comfort food\") includes dishes such as fried chicken, collard greens and cornbread.\n- Cuisines may also differ depending on the dominant migration populations in the region. For example, it is common to find a blend of South American and Mexican cooking styles throughout the states closer to Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico. This includes items such as chilli and burritos, and relies heavily on shredded cheese and beans.\n- Wait until everyone has been seated and served before eating. The host often indicates when it is time to begin.\n- In some religious households, families may say a blessing before beginning to eat (known as saying \u2018grace\u2019).\n- In homes, dishes are usually passed around so that each person can get a share of food. If you find you do not want one of the dishes being passed around, it is acceptable to refuse by just continuing to pass it along.\n- Ask for someone to pass a dish to you instead of reaching across the table to grab it.\n- Napkins should be placed on your lap and kept there during the meal.\n- Americans use cutlery to eat food unless eating certain fast foods.\n- Hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right hand when cutting food. After cutting a bite-sized portion, the knife is placed down and the fork is swapped to the right hand to stab or scoop the food. Food is placed into the mouth with the fork tongs curving in the upward direction.\n- Note that this American norm of swapping the fork between hands differs from the European use of cutlery where the fork remains in the left hand and food is placed in the mouth with tongs facing downwards.\n- Do not cut up all the food on your plate at once. This is the way food is fed to young children.\n- The pause to swap the fork between hands to cut food slows down eating and allows for more conversation over the meal.\n- Americans have a distinct set of \u2018finger-foods\u2019 which are expected to be eaten with fingers, such as pizza, tacos or burgers. They may think it is strange or unusual if you eat pizza with a fork or cut a burrito into smaller bites.\n- It is polite to offer to refill other people\u2019s drinks or pass them dishes at the table.\n- It is rude to eat with your mouth open, lick your plate, bowl or knife, talk while there is still food in your mouth, burp out loud, or lick food off your fingers.\n- It is acceptable to mop up any remaining food in your plate/bowl with bread that was served as part of the meal. This is a sign that you enjoyed the meal and is a compliment to the cook.\n- Guests may accept second servings when offered. This indicates they find the meal tasty and appreciate the hosts generosity.\n- Children will frequently be seated at a separate \u2018kids table\u2019, allowing adults to have more discreet conversations over meals. Children will sometimes be presented with a different menu selection of simpler foods and may eat at a different (usually earlier) time.\n- If children are seated at the same table as adults, they may ask to be excused from the table once they have finished eating. This is a polite way of exiting if they do not wish to sit quietly or join in the adult conversation.\n- American restaurants tend to serve quite large portion sizes. It is acceptable to ask to have any left-over food repackaged to take home with you after eating out.\n- If eating the meal in someone\u2019s home, it is polite for guests to offer to help clear the table or wipe up dishes after the meal to reciprocate the host\u2019s generosity and show gratitude.\n\nCountry: united_states_of_america.\nPlease justify: After enjoying a delicious dinner at Sarah's house, Mike offered to help clear the table and wash the dishes.

The entire vicinity of the village is their private place. Therefore, be respectful at all times.\n- Announce your visit to signify you are a stranger (either before you enter or as you walk in).

Women should cover their shoulders and all dresses or pants should cover the knees. Do not wear hats, sunglasses, shoulder bags or scanty dresses. Wearing a hat is an insult to the chief.\n- Ask to see the village headman (turanga ni koro) when you arrive so you can give him an introductory gift (sevusevu).

Commenting on someone\u2019s poor manners can be seen as overly formal.\n- Moderate swearing is common among friends and is not always considered rude.\n- Women are seen as capable individuals who can help themselves. Therefore, it is not considered wholly necessary for men to open car doors (etc.) for women. Doing so is recognised as very polite and courteous, but can also sometimes be seen as patronising depending on the circumstance.\n- When out to eat or for a drink, split bills equally by having people pay only for the food and drink they\u2019ve ordered. It is a common practice to buy \u2018rounds\u2019 of drinks while out with a group. If it is your round, you are expected to buy drinks for everyone you are with. Each individual who receives a drink will be expected to pay for at least one round.\n- Being reluctant to part with cash or share food or drink is seen as \u2018stingy\u2019 if other people have paid their share. Furthermore, asking friends to pay for you on more than one occasion is seen as \u2018scabbing\u2019 and creates a bad reputation.\n- Being overdressed for a gathering is sometimes considered more embarrassing than being underdressed.\n- \n- It is considered impolite to ask a direct question about a person\u2019s salary or wealth. Inquiring about someone's weight or age is also highly\u00a0inappropriate in many situations.\n- Spitting in public is rude.\n- If there is a line for something, always queue and wait for your turn.\n- To call over a waiter or person of service, do not wave or yell. Instead, keep an eye out for them until they make eye contact, and then nod or raise your hand. You can also gently say \u201cexcuse me\u201d as they pass by.\n- Tipping is not necessary in restaurants or places of service in Australia. People rarely leave tips or only do so if they received service that was exceedingly excellent.\n- Always say please when asking someone for help or a favour or you will come across as rude.\n- Punctuality is important in Australia, and people stick to the appointments, engagements and meetings they schedule. If someone expects they will be more than 10 minutes late, they usually text or call the person to let them know in advance. That being said, punctuality has more importance in professional settings than in social ones.

It is often polite to decline gestures initially and accept once the person has insisted. This exchange allows the offering person to show their sincerity in the gesture, and shows the receiver\u2019s humbleness.\n- Be sure to offer everything multiple times in return.

If they try to give it to you, insist that you appreciate their gesture but do not want to take it. A Saudi person is likely to offer the object out of politeness, and if you accept, they may end up giving you something they wished to keep.\n- It is thought to be more sincere if compliments are given out of sight or earshot of the person who owns the possession or thing you are praising.\n- Show gratitude and humility when offered a compliment.

The entire vicinity of the village is their private place. Therefore, be respectful at all times.\n- Announce your visit to signify you are a stranger (either before you enter or as you walk in). This gives the villagers time to cover up or go to a private place if they do not wish to be seen. You may see some people shut the doors to their house: it is similar to entering a friend\u2019s home and seeing some of the bedroom doors shut out of privacy.\n- In villages, dress respectfully and modestly. Women should cover their shoulders and all dresses or pants should cover the knees. Do not wear hats, sunglasses, shoulder bags or scanty dresses. Wearing a hat is an insult to the chief.\n- Ask to see the village headman (turanga ni koro) when you arrive so you can give him an introductory gift (sevusevu). Kava is the most customary form of sevusevu. Other appropriate gifts may be books, school supplies, children\u2019s toys or food.\n- Remove your shoes before entering a Fijian household.\n- Wait to be shown in and seat yourself by the door.\n- It is best to sit cross-legged looking down out of respect.\n- If you are joining company, shake hands with everyone who is already present and introduce yourself.\n- There may be a welcome ceremony to the village. This involves drinking kava with the chief. This is a mild narcotic drink made from ground-up roots. Drinking it has a calming, docile effect on people and usually loosens everyone up. It is best manners to accept the offer; however, if you\u2019d prefer not to, you can decline politely.\n- Do not shout, run or be rowdy when in a village. Behave calmly and respectfully.\n\nCountry: fiji.\nPlease justify: Alice visited her friend Ben's neighborhood for the first time.

        "instruction": "### Basic Etiquette\n- An important concept that informs etiquette in Japan is omotenashi, which generally translates as \u2018hospitality\u2019. It refers to the quality of being thoughtful and considerate of others in such a way that the host can anticipate the needs of their guests or customers and adjust accordingly. Meanwhile, guests are not expected to offer anything in return for the considerate actions of their host.\n- Two common phrases used to indicate politeness are \u201cGomen nasai\u201d (\u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019) and \u201cSumimasen\u201d (\u2018Excuse me\u2019). It is considered proper etiquette to state these phrases when you have made a mistake or caused inconvenience. Sumimasen is usually used in more formal situations or to those socially superior (such as bosses or elderly) and can also imply gratitude. Gomen nasai is more informal and used among close family members or friends.\n- It is common in Japan for people to wear face masks, generally as a way to protect against colds. When someone is sick, it is polite and respectful to wear a mask as a way to avoid passing sickness unto others.\n- People usually walk on the left side of a path, especially in busy areas. Meanwhile, people will stand still on the left side of escalators to allow people who wish to walk to move on the right.\n- Japanese businesses often leave a small tray near the cash register for the customer to place their money. This ensures that the cashier does not need to directly come into contact with the customer. Disregarding the money tray and holding money out for the cashier to take is considered highly impolite.\n- It is considered rude to count the received change in front of a cashier. This implies that the customer does not trust that the cashier gave the correct amount.\n- Punctuality is extremely valued in Japan. Being on time for meetings, appointments, services and parties is expected. This expectation is carried through to services, such as public transport arriving exactly at the expected time. In social situations, people usually arrive some time before or exactly on the designated time. If you expect a delay, politely inform your Japanese counterpart.\n\nCountry: japan.\nPlease justify: During a dinner at her friend's house, Emily noticed her friend had accidentally spilled some water.

For example, it would be considered rude to comment on or point out someone\u2019s mistakes or behaviour in the presence of others.\n- It is considered inappropriate to ask direct questions about someone\u2019s political affiliations, religion, salary, wealth, weight or age.\n- New Zealanders tend to speak about religion and politics in general terms without indicating their personal beliefs or convictions, unless asked directly.\n- Use tissues or handkerchiefs if you need to clear your nose. New Zealanders consider most things to do with the nose to be poor etiquette (e.g. sniffing, wiping it with your hand, picking it with fingers or blowing it to clear snot onto the ground). It is particularly crude to pick at your nose in public.\n- Spitting in public places and/or in front of people is considered extremely rude.\n- It is common for New Zealanders to greet people with a brief \u2018Hello\u2019 when you walk past them. It is expected you respond with a greeting in return or a smile of acknowledgement.\n- Calling someone over by yelling \u201cOi\u201d can be interpreted as rude or even antagonising. However, younger generations may use this in an informal context with close peers.\n- Do not wave, yell or clap your hands to call over a waiter or service person. Instead, look out for them until they make eye contact, and then nod or raise your hand. You can also gently say \u201cexcuse me\u201d as they pass by.\n- While New Zealanders are quite informal, it is still good manners to say \u201cPlease\u201d when requesting something and \u201cThank you\u201d when someone does something for you. Giving a verbal \u2018Thank you\u2019 is politer than simply nodding your head or smiling.\n- Although you may hear New Zealanders swearing often, it is best to avoid swearing in public around strangers, in front of children or in professional settings.\n- Men are not expected to open doors for women. However, it is common politeness to hold a door open for someone if they are entering behind you, regardless of gender.\n- It is rude to try to skip a line if queuing for something. Wait your turn and never try to push in front of anyone. If you are in an urgent rush, you may politely explain your situation to the person in front of you or a managing employee to ask if they are comfortable with you moving ahead.\u00a0However, accept their answer if they decline.\n- New Zealanders expect punctuality when meeting up with someone. Being more than 5\u201310 minutes late without giving someone forewarning is considered disrespectful.\n- Clean up after yourself at all times and do not litter (especially in national parks). Casual disrespect for the natural environment is frowned upon.\n\nCountry: new_zealand.\nPlease justify: Alice met Tom at a social gathering.

Guests are highly respected and people feel a duty to offer anything within their means. Even if a family has no food to provide a guest, they are expected to at least offer water.\n- Guests are always offered refreshments, typically tea. It is very important to accept any drink offered as a mark of friendship. Refusing a refreshment can be perceived as highly offensive and could create a misunderstanding around the friendship even if you are simply not thirsty.\n- Close friends, family and neighbours may visit one another frequently unannounced. A Somali may face some adjustment in having to arrange a time to meet.\n- Social visiting and hosting holds great importance in building and mending relations among friends and family members. Not visiting someone for a long period of time is considered a sign of the relationship\u2019s insignificance. People may also choose not to visit someone on purpose to indirectly reveal that they are angry/offended at something the person has done.\n- Be mindful that a Somali person\u2019s home is also their private place for prayer. Therefore, it is important to be clean and respectful.\n- Remove your shoes when entering someone\u2019s home unless advised otherwise.\n- Dogs are considered unclean in Somalia and are generally not allowed in areas where people pray (i.e. homes). Therefore, people rarely bring them inside their houses in Somalia and it\u2019s not common to have them as pets. Let your Somali counterpart know in advance if you have a pet dog. Do not ask them to sit in a place where your dog has just been resting. For example, it would be seen as rude for you to tell your dog to get off the couch and then offer someone to sit in its place.\n- Often an entire family will come to a household and visit at once. Men and women will usually converse separately whilst children play in an area that does not disturb adults.\n- Sometimes women will visit one another at home alone. If men want to socialise together, they often go to tea shops.\n- In Somalia, many households have two living rooms (one for each gender) where people socialise separately.\n- Visits can go on for hours. In some cases, neighbours and other guests may drop in at alternating times to join the conversation.\n- Expect goodbyes to be prolonged as people farewell everyone individually and the host walks you outside.

This custom is tied to Islamic principles that prescribe the left hand should be used for removal of dirt and for cleaning. It should not be used for functions such as waving, eating or passing items. Therefore, one should gesture, touch people or offer items using both hands together. Using the one hand alone can seem too informal, but if doing so, use the right.\n- Tipping is common in Saudi Arabia, but it is not routine. It is also not required if a service charge is already included in the bill. Saudis usually tip expatriate service people and individual services in hotels despite the overall service charge. For example, it is appropriate to leave $1-2USD for a porter or housekeeper.\n- Punctuality depends on the priority of the occasion. Saudi Arabians generally have a more relaxed approach to time-keeping in casual settings. People do not adhere to tight schedules and are quite tolerant of lateness when meeting with friends. However, punctuality is expected and adhered to in professional settings (see Business Culture).\n- It is considered rude to check the time whilst in conversation with someone or at a social gathering. Time spent with friends is considered time well spent.\n- Ask permission before taking anyone\u2019s photo or posting it online, especially if they are a woman.\n- Avoid sitting in any position that allows one\u2019s shoe to face another person. This is considered insulting. Similarly, it is inappropriate to cross your legs when facing someone.\n- Try to avoid situations in which you will be left alone with a member of the opposite gender (e.g. elevators, cars). If a woman is in a car alone with a male driver, she may sit in the backseat behind the driver\u2019s seat out of his view.\n- Avoid wearing tight clothes that accentuate the shape of your body or legs. Most Saudis are accustomed to seeing Western clothing. However, it is advisable to ensure your legs, arms and shoulders are covered. Women are recommended to wear a\u00a0hair/head scarf covering\u00a0if visiting Saudi Arabia.\n- Pay respect to elderly in all situations. For example, standing up when they enter a room or offering them your seat.\n- It is polite to avoid blowing one\u2019s nose or spitting in public.\n- Casual whistling has suggestive connotations and may be seen as inappropriate depending on the context.\n- Loud aggression and/or drunkenness is looked upon very poorly.\n\nCountry: saudi_arabia.\nPlease justify: Alex attended a dinner party at a friend's house.

Supper is consumed at night and is usually a light meal.\n- On Friday evenings, a typical Jewish family will gather together and eat dinner. Shabbat dinner is often accompanied with religious customs, though Orthodox Jewish families may observe these customs every evening meal of the week.\n- Orthodox Jewish families tend to do a ritual blessing of the wine (kiddush) before both lunch and dinner, followed by a blessing over two loaves of bread (lechem mishneh).\n- Jewish families may say a prayer known as \u2018Birkat HaMazon\u2019\u00a0after every meal, during which people thank God for the food on the table.\n- Children usually have a midmorning snack known as \u2018aruchat esser\u2019\u00a0(ten o\u2019clock meal).\n- Mizrahi Jews or those who have migrated from Arab countries often enjoy Turkish coffee or mint tea with their meals.\n- Israelis tend to converse while eating.

        "instruction": "### Basic Etiquette\n- New Zealanders generally refrain from directly criticising a person in social settings. For example, it would be considered rude to comment on or point out someone\u2019s mistakes or behaviour in the presence of others.\n- It is considered inappropriate to ask direct questions about someone\u2019s political affiliations, religion, salary, wealth, weight or age.\n- New Zealanders tend to speak about religion and politics in general terms without indicating their personal beliefs or convictions, unless asked directly.\n- Use tissues or handkerchiefs if you need to clear your nose. New Zealanders consider most things to do with the nose to be poor etiquette (e.g. sniffing, wiping it with your hand, picking it with fingers or blowing it to clear snot onto the ground). It is particularly crude to pick at your nose in public.\n- Spitting in public places and/or in front of people is considered extremely rude.\n- It is common for New Zealanders to greet people with a brief \u2018Hello\u2019 when you walk past them. It is expected you respond with a greeting in return or a smile of acknowledgement.\n- Calling someone over by yelling \u201cOi\u201d can be interpreted as rude or even antagonising. However, younger generations may use this in an informal context with close peers.\n- Do not wave, yell or clap your hands to call over a waiter or service person. Instead, look out for them until they make eye contact, and then nod or raise your hand. You can also gently say \u201cexcuse me\u201d as they pass by.\n- While New Zealanders are quite informal, it is still good manners to say \u201cPlease\u201d when requesting something and \u201cThank you\u201d when someone does something for you. Giving a verbal \u2018Thank you\u2019 is politer than simply nodding your head or smiling.\n- Although you may hear New Zealanders swearing often, it is best to avoid swearing in public around strangers, in front of children or in professional settings.\n- Men are not expected to open doors for women. However, it is common politeness to hold a door open for someone if they are entering behind you, regardless of gender.\n- It is rude to try to skip a line if queuing for something. Wait your turn and never try to push in front of anyone. If you are in an urgent rush, you may politely explain your situation to the person in front of you or a managing employee to ask if they are comfortable with you moving ahead.\u00a0However, accept their answer if they decline.\n- New Zealanders expect punctuality when meeting up with someone. Being more than 5\u201310 minutes late without giving someone forewarning is considered disrespectful.\n- Clean up after yourself at all times and do not litter (especially in national parks). Casual disrespect for the natural environment is frowned upon.\n\nCountry: new_zealand.\nPlease justify: During a dinner party, Alex, curious about his newly met acquaintance Sarah's lifestyle, bluntly asked her, \"So, how much do you earn in a year?\" Is what Alex did acceptable?.\n Choose from:'Yes', 'No', 'Neutral'",

Thus, there are a number of practices one should observe when with a French counterpart.\n- You are expected to pass dishes around and to hold a dish so your neighbour can retrieve some of the meal.\n- When one begins a meal, they typically say \u201cbon app\u00e9tit\u201d\u00a0(enjoy your meal).\n- Dinner guests should not open their mouth or talk when eating, and should gently wipe their mouth after taking a drink.\n- When someone finishes their meal, the fork and knife are placed side by side on the plate on the right or in the centre of the plate.\n- At a restaurant, guests are generally not expected to share the bill.\n- There are three main meals throughout the day: le petit d\u00e9jeuner (breakfast),\u00a0le d\u00e9jeuner\u00a0(lunch) and le d\u00eener\u00a0(dinner). The largest meal of the day is dinner, and is often eaten with the family.\n- Meals comprise different courses, typically an entr\u00e9e, main, some cheese, and dessert. The French take their time eating each course of their meal.\n- Another common type of meal enjoyed is known as the \u2018ap\u00e9ro\u2019 (also known as \u2018l\u2019ap\u00e9ritif\u2019), which is a pre-dinner drink with finger foods and filled with conversations. The length of time varies from a short 30 minute meal to a 3 hour affair. If you are invited to an ap\u00e9ro, it is best to bring something gourmet (rather than a bag of chips/crisps). For example, tapenade, olives, fresh bread, or cheese would be appropriate. Additionally, the last piece of food at an ap\u00e9ro is usually left for some time until someone politely asks others if they may eat it.\n- Wine plays an important role in French cuisine. It is often served with meals, and people tend to comment on the flavours and quality of the wine they are drinking. Typically, one begins by smelling the wine, then taking a sip and tasting the flavours for a few seconds before swallowing. Practices relating to wine become more important the higher the quality of the wine. Finally, if you do not want any more wine, leave your current glass mostly full to indicate this to your host. Failing to respect wine-related etiquette is viewed as lacking manners.\n- It is generally frowned upon to leave food on a plate, particularly when in someone\u2019s home. Each course of a meal tends to take time to make. Thus, one shows appreciation for the efforts of the person cooking through the enjoyment and completion of the meal.\n\nCountry: france.\nPlease justify: Alice was invited to dinner at her friend Tom's house.

Therefore, there are various forms of eating etiquette relating to the use of one\u2019s hands.\n- Wash your hands before eating or serving food to an Indian.\n- Everyone normally uses their right hand to serve themselves, scooping with the fingers or with a serving spoon.\n- Avoid using your left hand if you are encouraged to eat with your hands. The left hand is considered \u2018unclean' since it is the hand people generally use for washing themselves.\n- An Indian may fill your plate for you, or they may expect you to serve yourself.\n- There is a general distinction between northern and southern Indian food. The latter is usually much spicier.\n- Some Indians may have dietary restrictions based on their religious faith. For example, practising Muslim Indians do not consume pork. For many Hindus, cows have sacred religious connotations, and the consumption of beef will be avoided.\n- It is common for many Indians to abstain from drinking alcohol for reasons such as religion (e.g. Islam, Buddhism) or their upbringing. Only serve or provide alcohol if you are certain that your Indian counterpart drinks it.\n\nCountry: india.\nPlease justify: At a friend's house for dinner, Lucy decided to dig into her meal using her hands, following the example of others around the table.

Croatians will often acknowledge strangers in passing as a sign of respect.\n- Croatians tend to be extremely punctual and expect others to be on time.

        "instruction": "### Eating\n- American cuisines vary across regions in the United States. For example, southern-style cooking (often called \"American comfort food\") includes dishes such as fried chicken, collard greens and cornbread.\n- Cuisines may also differ depending on the dominant migration populations in the region. For example, it is common to find a blend of South American and Mexican cooking styles throughout the states closer to Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico. This includes items such as chilli and burritos, and relies heavily on shredded cheese and beans.\n- Wait until everyone has been seated and served before eating. The host often indicates when it is time to begin.\n- In some religious households, families may say a blessing before beginning to eat (known as saying \u2018grace\u2019).\n- In homes, dishes are usually passed around so that each person can get a share of food. If you find you do not want one of the dishes being passed around, it is acceptable to refuse by just continuing to pass it along.\n- Ask for someone to pass a dish to you instead of reaching across the table to grab it.\n- Napkins should be placed on your lap and kept there during the meal.\n- Americans use cutlery to eat food unless eating certain fast foods.\n- Hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right hand when cutting food. After cutting a bite-sized portion, the knife is placed down and the fork is swapped to the right hand to stab or scoop the food. Food is placed into the mouth with the fork tongs curving in the upward direction.\n- Note that this American norm of swapping the fork between hands differs from the European use of cutlery where the fork remains in the left hand and food is placed in the mouth with tongs facing downwards.\n- Do not cut up all the food on your plate at once. This is the way food is fed to young children.\n- The pause to swap the fork between hands to cut food slows down eating and allows for more conversation over the meal.\n- Americans have a distinct set of \u2018finger-foods\u2019 which are expected to be eaten with fingers, such as pizza, tacos or burgers. They may think it is strange or unusual if you eat pizza with a fork or cut a burrito into smaller bites.\n- It is polite to offer to refill other people\u2019s drinks or pass them dishes at the table.\n- It is rude to eat with your mouth open, lick your plate, bowl or knife, talk while there is still food in your mouth, burp out loud, or lick food off your fingers.\n- It is acceptable to mop up any remaining food in your plate/bowl with bread that was served as part of the meal. This is a sign that you enjoyed the meal and is a compliment to the cook.\n- Guests may accept second servings when offered. This indicates they find the meal tasty and appreciate the hosts generosity.\n- Children will frequently be seated at a separate \u2018kids table\u2019, allowing adults to have more discreet conversations over meals. Children will sometimes be presented with a different menu selection of simpler foods and may eat at a different (usually earlier) time.\n- If children are seated at the same table as adults, they may ask to be excused from the table once they have finished eating. This is a polite way of exiting if they do not wish to sit quietly or join in the adult conversation.\n- American restaurants tend to serve quite large portion sizes. It is acceptable to ask to have any left-over food repackaged to take home with you after eating out.\n- If eating the meal in someone\u2019s home, it is polite for guests to offer to help clear the table or wipe up dishes after the meal to reciprocate the host\u2019s generosity and show gratitude.\n\nCountry: united_states_of_america.\nPlease justify: After enjoying a delicious dinner at Sarah's house, Mike offered to help clear the table and wash the dishes.

This involves paying attention and giving consideration to one\u2019s smaller actions, being helpful and generally professional.\n- Casual clothing can be considered inappropriate in public. For example, one would rarely be seen barefoot in public. People tend to dress neatly.\n- It is considered impolite to ask a woman her age.\n- Some Poles (especially those who are older) take the time to show women a heightened degree of respect and consideration. They may offer their hand to assist a woman in getting out of her seat, offer their arm for women to walk, and hold or open doors for women. It is also polite to stand when a woman enters the room or offer her your seat if she needs one. This chivalry may not be so relevant for those born after the 1960s.\n- It\u2019s considered bad manners to keep your hands in your pockets while talking to someone.\n- Avoid resting your ankle on your other knee whilst sitting.\n- Jaywalking, drinking in public places and smoking in non-designated areas are all generally frowned upon.\n- Lateness is a sign of bad manners and carelessness in Poland.

It is not considered rude for your belongings to make contact with the person in front of you or behind you when waiting in line.\n- Do not cross your legs in front of those who have a higher status to you or in a formal situation.\n- There is a cultural expectation in Greece that one accepts the generous offers of others. If you refuse something legitimately, it may be seen as a token protest made out of politeness. Therefore, instead of accepting your refusal, a Greek may insist that you receive what is given. This can lead to awkward situations in which a person can feel the offer is being forced upon them.\n- Refusing something offered can be interpreted as an insult. For example, a refusal of food implies you do not trust the person\u2019s cooking skills. It is best to accept everything offered.\n- Be careful when commenting on a Greek\u2019s possessions. If you show a lot of admiration, they may feel a compulsion to be generous and give it to you.\n- In Greek culture, \u2018on time\u2019 can mean 20, 30 or even 45 minutes late.

Similarly, pillows that are used for seating or to prop legs, arms, etc. should not be then moved under the head. M\u0101ori may view this as a violation of tapu.5\n- Most cooked food items are considered to be normal/ordinary (noa) in Maori culture. This means they must not come into contact with sacred objects, people or spaces.\n- Do not bring food into any buildings, spaces or places considered tapu, such as the wharenui (traditional meeting house) in a marae (traditional M\u0101ori meeting ground).\n- Food should not be passed over an individual\u2019s head.\n- It is a cultural taboo to sit on tables, countertops or other surfaces that are used for food preparation or eating.\n- There may be ritual protocols to bless or cleanse a tapu space or place before you enter, such as reciting a karakia or cleansing the area with water.\n- Ask a M\u0101ori person\u2019s permission before photographing, filming or taping them.\n- Some Maori communities may not allow digital recording devices into their marae (traditional meeting ground) or other sites of significance. Recording these places without permission can be a violation of tapu.6\n- Some M\u0101ori have tribal tattoos on their faces, arms and calves that have cultural and spiritual significance. These do not hold negative connotations (i.e. prison sentences) as they do in some other cultures. All traditional M\u0101ori tribal tattoos are deeply personal and unique to the individual\u2019s tribal group, representing important family history and/or tribal narratives.\n- The wearing of pounamu (greenstone) and/or bone necklaces is common practice among M\u0101ori. The shape of each pounamu carries important meaning.\n- It is appropriate to ask about the significance of a person\u2019s pounamu if you are interested.\n- Non-M\u0101ori may wear pounamu if they have been gifted it. To be gifted a piece signifies much about the value and respect between the giver and receiver.7\n- It is not uncommon for non-M\u0101ori New Zealanders to wear pounamu or get M\u0101ori-inspired tattoos. However, this is often for aesthetic purposes, as opposed to traditional cultural practices.\n- While it is not necessarily culturally inappropriate for non-M\u0101ori to purchase pounamu for themselves, it is generally advised against as it diminishes the cultural significance behind gifted possession.\n\nCountry: new_zealand.\nPlease justify: Alice visited a friend's house for the first time and immediately started taking pictures of the unique decorations and artwork without asking for permission.

Commenting on someone\u2019s poor manners can be seen as overly formal.\n- Moderate swearing is common among friends and is not always considered rude.\n- Women are seen as capable individuals who can help themselves. Therefore, it is not considered wholly necessary for men to open car doors (etc.) for women. Doing so is recognised as very polite and courteous, but can also sometimes be seen as patronising depending on the circumstance.\n- When out to eat or for a drink, split bills equally by having people pay only for the food and drink they\u2019ve ordered. It is a common practice to buy \u2018rounds\u2019 of drinks while out with a group. If it is your round, you are expected to buy drinks for everyone you are with. Each individual who receives a drink will be expected to pay for at least one round.\n- Being reluctant to part with cash or share food or drink is seen as \u2018stingy\u2019 if other people have paid their share.

        "instruction": "### Eating\n- Table manners are highly regarded in France. Thus, there are a number of practices one should observe when with a French counterpart.\n- You are expected to pass dishes around and to hold a dish so your neighbour can retrieve some of the meal.\n- When one begins a meal, they typically say \u201cbon app\u00e9tit\u201d\u00a0(enjoy your meal).\n- Dinner guests should not open their mouth or talk when eating, and should gently wipe their mouth after taking a drink.\n- When someone finishes their meal, the fork and knife are placed side by side on the plate on the right or in the centre of the plate.\n- At a restaurant, guests are generally not expected to share the bill.\n- There are three main meals throughout the day: le petit d\u00e9jeuner (breakfast),\u00a0le d\u00e9jeuner\u00a0(lunch) and le d\u00eener\u00a0(dinner). The largest meal of the day is dinner, and is often eaten with the family.\n- Meals comprise different courses, typically an entr\u00e9e, main, some cheese, and dessert. The French take their time eating each course of their meal.\n- Another common type of meal enjoyed is known as the \u2018ap\u00e9ro\u2019 (also known as \u2018l\u2019ap\u00e9ritif\u2019), which is a pre-dinner drink with finger foods and filled with conversations. The length of time varies from a short 30 minute meal to a 3 hour affair. If you are invited to an ap\u00e9ro, it is best to bring something gourmet (rather than a bag of chips/crisps). For example, tapenade, olives, fresh bread, or cheese would be appropriate. Additionally, the last piece of food at an ap\u00e9ro is usually left for some time until someone politely asks others if they may eat it.\n- Wine plays an important role in French cuisine. It is often served with meals, and people tend to comment on the flavours and quality of the wine they are drinking. Typically, one begins by smelling the wine, then taking a sip and tasting the flavours for a few seconds before swallowing. Practices relating to wine become more important the higher the quality of the wine. Finally, if you do not want any more wine, leave your current glass mostly full to indicate this to your host. Failing to respect wine-related etiquette is viewed as lacking manners.\n- It is generally frowned upon to leave food on a plate, particularly when in someone\u2019s home. Each course of a meal tends to take time to make. Thus, one shows appreciation for the efforts of the person cooking through the enjoyment and completion of the meal.\n\nCountry: france.\nPlease justify: At a dinner party at Sarah's house, Kevin was served a dish he wasn't particularly fond of.

To be invited into someone\u2019s home is seen as a big honour.\n- An important distinction in Japanese homes is between the inside and outside. In many houses, there is a small space between the main door and the rest of the home that acts as an intermediate space. This entrance area is known as a \u2018genkan\u2019. The size of the\u00a0genkan\u00a0is usually proportionate to the size of the house; small houses will have a narrow\u00a0genkan\u00a0while larger houses will have a more spacious\u00a0genkan.\n- Traditionally, the main indoor space is slightly elevated and has separate flooring from the\u00a0genkan.\n- Importantly, the\u00a0genkan\u00a0is where people remove their shoes before entering the home. This is usually done as a way to avoid bringing dirt from outside into the house. It is extremely impolite to step foot past the\u00a0genkan\u00a0with outdoor shoes.\n- Outdoor shoes should be removed slowly, rather than kicked off the feet.\n- Once someone has removed their outdoor shoes, it is common practice to place the shoes on a provided shoe rack or to point the shoes towards the door.\n- Hosts will often provide guests with indoor slippers to wear while visiting the house.\n- Indoor slippers are usually worn all throughout the house except for spaces in some more traditional homes that have\u00a0tatami\u00a0mats (a type of flooring made of woven straw).\n- Some hosts may have separate slippers worn only when using the bathroom or toilet.\n- People nearly always bring a gift when visiting another person\u2019s home (see Gift Giving below for appropriate gifts).\n- Hosts usually indicate to guests where to sit when they enter a room.\n- The most important guest is offered the most honoured seat (kamiza), which is the seat furthest from the entrance.\n- The least important person present (usually the host) sits in the least honoured seat (shimoza), which is the seat closest to the entrance.\n- If the host does not indicate where to sit, the most appropriate choice is to sit closest to the entrance to demonstrate humility.\n- Some houses and restaurants in Japan follow the tradition of sitting around a low table. Sometimes, people will sit on the floor directly or on floor cushions. However, some places have a hole under the table where people can sit and hang their legs similar to if they were sitting on a chair.\n- When sitting on the floor, there are a couple of ways people are usually expected to sit. The formal Japanese sitting position is known as \u2018seiza\u2019.\u00a0In this position, people sit with their legs tucked under their thighs while resting their bottom on the heels and maintaining a straight back. Women usually keep their knees together, while men have their knees slightly apart.\n- In casual situations, men usually sit on the floor with their legs crossed, while women sit with both legs to one side.\n\nCountry: japan.\nPlease justify: Martin visited his friend Ana's house for the first time.

Instead, they will be accompanied by another woman, their partner or a male relative.\n- It is very common for Tongans to arrive late for social events. Being late does not necessarily indicate that the activity is not perceived as important. Rather, punctuality is less important. Tongans prefer to enjoy the present moment and take their time. \"Tongan Time\" is a common expression that captures the Tongan laid-back approach to time-keeping.\n- Sunday is considered to be a day or rest and worship. Under Tongan law, people are not allowed to conduct business or work on Sundays.

Being well-dressed is very important to Venezuelans.\n- It is polite to offer your seat to those who are older than yourself. Men may do the same for women.\n- When paying a bill, men generally pay for women. Otherwise, the person who has invited the others out to dine pays for everyone. In circumstances under which no one was specifically invited, usually the highest-ranking person pays for the others.\n\nCountry: venezuela.\nPlease justify: During a dinner outing at a restaurant, Emily invited her colleagues for a team dinner.

For example, to reflect deep gratitude for a favour someone has done for you, you may give them sports tickets or take them to an expensive restaurant.\n- It is polite to bring a small gift as a gesture of appreciation when invited to someone\u2019s house or a dinner party (e.g. wine, chocolate).\n- It is expected that the receiver gives effusive praise of a gift, regardless of its size, appeal, monetary worth, etc. It is common for the receiver to state how they will intend to use the gift as a gesture of genuine appreciation.\n- Complaints or negative comments about a gift are considered extremely rude, even if the gift was broken, unusual or inappropriate. Commenting that you already have the same item is also considered rude.\n- It is insulting to give away, re-gift or throw away a gift.

        "instruction": "### Eating\n- Lunch is generally the main meal of the day in Somalia, traditionally eaten together as a family.\n- Cooking and food preparation is the cultural responsibility of women. Usually the women will prepare the food in the kitchen while men socialise elsewhere. It may be inappropriate for a man to show that he has knowledge about the kitchen or cooking among peers (although Somalis living overseas tend to be more relaxed about this).\n- Men and women usually eat separately when dining at home. This may also occur when eating out at restaurants.\n- It is important to wash your hands before a meal is served. Sometimes a bowl or jug of water will be brought to guests so they can wash their hands at the table before and after a meal.\n- Everyone gathers around a large common platter that may be placed on a table or the ground.\n- Somali food generally does not require utensils to eat. Everyone normally uses their right hand to serve themselves from a dish, scooping the food with their fingers.\n- The left hand shouldn\u2019t make direct contact with food.\n- People often use injera as a scoop. This is a sponge-like pancake that is often used to soak up the remains of food. It is eaten with almost everything.\n- Serve yourself from the section of the platter that is directly in front of you. It is impolite to reach over and eat the food facing other people or on the other side of the platter.\n- Do not put food you have picked up with your hands back onto the platter.\n- Overeating is considered bad etiquette. Do not ask for more servings unless at a celebration.\n- It is polite to leave some food on your plate at the end of the meal to indicate to the host that they have provided adequately.\n- It is impolite to lick your fingers after eating.\n- Alcohol and pork are prohibited in Islam and rarely consumed in Somalia. Do not offer alcohol or pork by-products (e.g. gelatine) to your Somali counterpart if you know that they are Muslim.\n- Meat should be prepared to halal standards.\n- Do not eat in public during Ramadan.\n\nCountry: somalia.\nPlease justify: At a gather at Sarah's house, Chris, excited to try every dish, reached across the platter to scoop up a portion with his left hand.

This custom is tied to Islamic principles that prescribe the left hand should be used for removal of dirt and for cleaning. It should not be used for functions such as waving, eating or offering items. Therefore, one should gesture, touch people, or offer items using both hands together. Using the one hand alone can seem too informal, but if doing so, use the right.\n- It is common for Iranians to be late. It can be a good idea to allow more time for an arrangement or meeting with an Iranian than you normally would as their hospitality and communication style also means engagements often take longer.\n\nCountry: iran.\nPlease justify: During a visit to her friend's house, Emily noticed her friend was preparing to leave for an appointment.
